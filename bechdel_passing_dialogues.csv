1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"We come in peace. That's why we're here. Isn't that the whole idea of Starfleet? Hey, I taught you that."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Hey, I taught you that. You don't trust me, Captain?"
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"You don't trust me, Captain? I trust you with my life, Commander Burnham, but it doesn't change the fact that you're lost. Very lost."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"I trust you with my life, Commander Burnham, but it doesn't change the fact that you're lost. Very lost. Technically, we would be lost."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Technically, we would be lost. How long until that storm comes crashing down on us?"
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"How long until that storm comes crashing down on us? I estimate one hour, 17 minutes, 22 seconds. Which is why I've made sure we're not lost. The map says the well is this way, Captain."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"This drought's going to last 89 years. The Crepusculans are facing extinction as a species. See those egg sacs? Those are their offspring. They've survived here for over a thousand years, Michael."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"They've survived here for over a thousand years, Michael. Right, and if we don't do something now, they won't live another thousand hours. The ambient radiation from a nearby drilling accident dried out their water table. If we can get in and out without making contact, we can steer clear of General Order One. And there is the well."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Right, and if we don't do something now, they won't live another thousand hours. The ambient radiation from a nearby drilling accident dried out their water table. If we can get in and out without making contact, we can steer clear of General Order One. And there is the well. I stand corrected."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,I stand corrected. Ye of little faith.
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Ye of little faith. Oh, never had a doubt. (powers up phaser rifle) Tell me what I need to break through this bedrock."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Oh, never had a doubt. (powers up phaser rifle) Tell me what I need to break through this bedrock. Point 7 second field burst at level setting 13.5."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,Point 7 second field burst at level setting 13.5. Georgiou to Shenzhou. Two to transport.
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Georgiou to Shenzhou. Two to transport. The storm is moving faster than I thought. The ship won't be able to pick up our signatures. Unless we can contact Lieutenant Saru, we could be trapped here until it's over."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"The storm is moving faster than I thought. The ship won't be able to pick up our signatures. Unless we can contact Lieutenant Saru, we could be trapped here until it's over. Let's take a walk."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Follow my footsteps, Michael, even lines. Why? Captain, where are we going?"
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Why? Captain, where are we going? It's your turn to trust me, Number One."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"It's your turn to trust me, Number One. But now we're really lost. We're far too small to be seen with the naked eye. And you can't set a course without a star. Is it wise to be heading away from the village?"
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,But now we're really lost. We're far too small to be seen with the naked eye. And you can't set a course without a star. Is it wise to be heading away from the village? It's hard to imagine you've served under me for seven years. I think it's time that we talked about you having your own command.
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"It's hard to imagine you've served under me for seven years. I think it's time that we talked about you having your own command. I'm grateful, Captain. Though I would be significantly more so if I thought we had any chance of ever returning to the ship."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"I'm grateful, Captain. Though I would be significantly more so if I thought we had any chance of ever returning to the ship. Just keep walking, Michael. What will you do if you were stuck here for 89 years?"
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Just keep walking, Michael. What will you do if you were stuck here for 89 years? A likely scenario unless we die here in the desert."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,A likely scenario unless we die here in the desert. But say you lived.
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"But say you lived. As a xenoanthropologist, I could reveal myself to the natives, learn their culture, try to fit in, if possible. And you, Captain? What will you do if we're trapped here for 89 years?"
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"As a xenoanthropologist, I could reveal myself to the natives, learn their culture, try to fit in, if possible. And you, Captain? What will you do if we're trapped here for 89 years? That's easy. I'd escape."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,That's easy. I'd escape. These are our footprints. You've walked us in a circle.
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,These are our footprints. You've walked us in a circle. Not exactly a circle.
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,Not exactly a circle. How did they find us?
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,How did they find us? I set a star.
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"I set a star. First Officer's Log, Stardate 1207.3. On Earth, it's May 11th, 2256. A Sunday. The crew of the USS Shenzhou has been called to the edge of Federation space to investigate damage done to one of our interstellar relays. Blast burns around the hole are inconclusive. Were they caused by an asteroid, or was it deliberately destroyed to limit Starfleet communications? And if so, by whom? Despite the risks of our mission, I remain optimistic. It's hard not to be in the face of such beauty. In this case, a binary star system. Around these two suns, ice, dust and gasses collide to form the planets future generations will call home. A humbling reminder that all life is born from chaos and destruction."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Finish your scans so you can express facts instead. The bridge is yours, Mister Saru. Yes, Number One."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Yes, Number One. Your Chief Science Officer is worried. Something took a bite out of our relay. Saru thinks it was malicious."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"By all indications, nothing intelligent. But?"
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"But? Starfleet's reputation for tech hygiene is exemplary. When a relay goes down, the Federation sends a ship to fix it."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Starfleet's reputation for tech hygiene is exemplary. When a relay goes down, the Federation sends a ship to fix it. You think someone's trying to get our attention?"
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"You think someone's trying to get our attention? If they are, they have."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"If they are, they have. Lieutenant Saru, what do we have?"
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"I'm shocked as well. Ensign Connor, agreement between my senior officers. Note the date and time. Is this amount of sarcasm always necessary?"
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Is this amount of sarcasm always necessary? Necessary, no. But I do like it."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Number One? Range is 2,000 kilometres. Bearing 358 mark 269. Roughly 150 metres long, tucked into that accretion disk almost directly below us. It's in a sensor dead zone. Some kind of scattering field is confounding the ship's ability to translate the image."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Range is 2,000 kilometres. Bearing 358 mark 269. Roughly 150 metres long, tucked into that accretion disk almost directly below us. It's in a sensor dead zone. Some kind of scattering field is confounding the ship's ability to translate the image. Thoughts, Number One?"
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Thoughts, Number One? With such little data, I'd prefer not to speculate."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"With such little data, I'd prefer not to speculate. Hiding, but maybe hoping to be found."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Hiding, but maybe hoping to be found. Here we are, speculating."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Here we are, speculating. I'm not sure we have much choice. We can't lock on to it, and we don't have a shuttle maneuverable enough to navigate the ring."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"I'm not sure we have much choice. We can't lock on to it, and we don't have a shuttle maneuverable enough to navigate the ring. I'll go. All I need is a thruster pack."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"You do understand that being afraid of everything means you learn nothing. There's no opportunity to discover, to explore. You're both right. Saru, go with her."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"You're both right. Saru, go with her. Best to keep variables to a minimum. I wouldn't want to put my colleague at risk."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Best to keep variables to a minimum. I wouldn't want to put my colleague at risk. And you, Mister Saru? Are you equally happy not to be put at risk?"
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"You realise, once you reach that scattering field, you could be cut off from all communication. We've come all this way, Captain. It would be irresponsible to leave whatever that is unknown."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"We've come all this way, Captain. It would be irresponsible to leave whatever that is unknown. Just a flyby."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,Just a flyby. Just a flyby.
1,1,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,Just a flyby. Commencing airlock depressurisation sequence.
1,1,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,Commencing airlock depressurisation sequence. This is Commander Burnham. Commencing reconnaissance mission to field void and unknown object. Data collection is on and nominal. All lights are green.
1,1,BURNHAM,DETMER,This is Commander Burnham. Commencing reconnaissance mission to field void and unknown object. Data collection is on and nominal. All lights are green. Confirming six second directional thrust for saucer realignment.
1,1,DETMER,COMPUTER,Confirming six second directional thrust for saucer realignment. Commencing final prelaunch system checks. Life support nominal. Oxygen nitrogen saturation nominal. Air pressure and flow nominal. Communication module active. Filters at 0.01% saturation.
1,1,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,"Commencing final prelaunch system checks. Life support nominal. Oxygen nitrogen saturation nominal. Air pressure and flow nominal. Communication module active. Filters at 0.01% saturation. Computer, enable igniter."
1,1,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,"Computer, enable igniter. Ten seconds to thruster ignition. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one."
1,1,COMPUTER,GEORGIOU,"Ten seconds to thruster ignition. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. She's having fun."
1,1,GEORGIOU,DETMER,"She's having fun. Almost to the debris field, Captain."
1,1,DETMER,GEORGIOU,"Almost to the debris field, Captain. Understood. Michael, watch your time."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Understood. Michael, watch your time. Aye, Captain."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Aye, Captain. Boost signal."
1,1,GEORGIOU,DETMER,"Boost signal. Mission clock at 17 minutes, 30 seconds."
1,1,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Mission clock at 17 minutes, 30 seconds. Shenzhou, do you copy?"
1,1,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,"Shenzhou, do you copy? Distance to object 1,000 kilometers and closing."
1,1,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,"Distance to object 1,000 kilometers and closing. Shenzhou, do you copy?"
1,1,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,"Shenzhou, do you copy? Implementing automatic course correction."
1,1,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,"Implementing automatic course correction. Hello. Shenzhou, are you able to see this?"
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Hello. Shenzhou, are you able to see this? Michael, can you hear me? Acknowledge. Michael, can you hear me? Acknowledge."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Michael, can you hear me? Acknowledge. Michael, can you hear me? Acknowledge. Shenzhou, do you copy? Data Collection Unit, are you there?"
1,1,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,"Shenzhou, do you copy? Data Collection Unit, are you there? Internal computer on line."
1,1,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,Internal computer on line. Good. Mission time?
1,1,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,"Good. Mission time? 12 minutes, 58 seconds."
1,1,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,"12 minutes, 58 seconds. Plenty of time to take a peek. Even from this distance, it's clearly not debris."
1,1,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Plenty of time to take a peek. Even from this distance, it's clearly not debris. The Commander is less than ten metres from the outermost edge of the scattering field."
1,1,DETMER,BURNHAM,"The Commander is less than ten metres from the outermost edge of the scattering field. I can't remember who said sculptures are crystallized spirituality. Headlamp. But I see what they meant. This is Burnham in the blind. I'm above the object, which is old. Centuries old. It's difficult to tell if it was constructed or carved. The only word to effectively describe it is wow. But I'll try to be more precise. Its surface has the appearance of stone with an exoskeleton of metal alloy. Oh, incredibly intricate. The construction and design are nothing short of astounding. I wish you could see what I'm seeing. It is sublime. It's impossible to discern a practical purpose. I'm going to land on it, get a closer look. Nice and easy. Hold on. My presence has triggered some sort of motion response."

1,1,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,Scanning for database recognition. Iconography confirmed. Klingon. I'm Commander Burnham of the United Federation of Planets.
1,1,BURNHAM,DETMER,I'm Commander Burnham of the United Federation of Planets. Still no sign of Commander Burnham. Mission clock runs out in 15 seconds.
1,1,DETMER,GEORGIOU,"Still no sign of Commander Burnham. Mission clock runs out in 15 seconds. Transporter Control. Do we have her, Mister Weeton?"
1,1,GEORGIOU,NARWANI,You better get me a signal. Remotely fire her jetpack. She's offline.
1,1,NARWANI,GEORGIOU,She's offline. Engineering. Tractor beam?
1,1,GEORGIOU,DETMER,Engineering. Tractor beam? She'll soon exhibit symptoms of acute radiation syndrome.
1,1,DETMER,GEORGIOU,She'll soon exhibit symptoms of acute radiation syndrome. Hang on.
1,1,GEORGIOU,COMPUTER,Hang on. Pupil Burnham. Pupil Burnham. Klingon social order rests upon?
1,1,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,Pupil Burnham. Pupil Burnham. Klingon social order rests upon? Inviolable honour-shame dynamic.
1,1,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,Inviolable honour-shame dynamic. Correct. Klingon homeworld Qo'noS.
1,1,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,Correct. Klingon homeworld Qo'noS. Unwelcoming to the Federation.
1,1,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,Unwelcoming to the Federation. Correct. Klingon political order.
1,1,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,Correct. Klingon political order. Twenty four great Houses.
1,1,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,Twenty four great Houses. Correct. Location of the most recent Klingon terror raid. Unacceptable duration between query and correct response. Number of survivors at the Human-Vulcan science outpost at Doctari Alpha.
1,1,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,Unacceptable duration between query and correct response. Number of survivors at Doctari Alpha. No.
1,1,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,No. Unacceptable response. Number of survivors
1,1,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,Unacceptable response. Number of survivors Please. Stop!
1,1,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,Please. Stop! Program paused.
1,1,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,Program paused. Sarek. I'm sorry. I can do better.
1,1,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,Three hours? Antiproton therapy regimen incomplete.
1,1,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,Session terminated prematurely. Medical Emergency. There's no time.
1,1,BURNHAM,DETMER,There's no time. The binaries are kicking off serious QEs up and down the spectrum.
1,1,DETMER,GEORGIOU,"The binaries are kicking off serious QEs up and down the spectrum. I want to know what's out there, people."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"I want to know what's out there, people. What's going on?"
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"What's going on? Number One, you should be in Sickbay."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Number One, you should be in Sickbay. What Have they made contact?"
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,What Have they made contact? Who's they?
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,Who's they? There are Klingons out there. We need to go to red alert.
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,There are Klingons out there. We need to go to red alert. Michael. Almost no one has seen a Klingon in a hundred years.
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,Michael. Almost no one has seen a Klingon in a hundred years. I have. One attacked me on that object. Check my helmet cam.
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,I have. One attacked me on that object. Check my helmet cam. The footage was corrupted.
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"I am not delusional. This has nothing to do with a concussion. Philippa, there are Klingons. Red alert. Tell me what happened."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"This is Federation space. Retreat is not an option. Whatever is over there needs to show itself. If it's hiding Klingons, we've got to flush them out. Target phase cannons on the object."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,I didn't say anything about destroying it. Let's make them think we're going to attack. Target the object.
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,Target the object. Wait.
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Wait. Then where did they come from? Mister Gant, disengage phase-cannon targeting. Number One, get to Sickbay. I need you fixed up and back on the bridge, stat. Mister Januzzi, contact Starfleet Command. Send an encoded message. Tell them we have engaged the Klingons."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Then where did they come from? Mister Gant, disengage phase-cannon targeting. Number One, get to Sickbay. I need you fixed up and back on the bridge, stat. Mister Januzzi, contact Starfleet Command. Send an encoded message. Tell them we have engaged the Klingons. Any response?"
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"I'm afraid that's no longer possible. The Klingon flagship has a stealth mode. It's some kind of cloaking screen, unlike anything we've ever seen, Admiral. There may be more vessels out there than we know. We've reached out with every form of friendship greeting Starfleet has. They're blocking our hails."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"You remember my First Officer, Michael Burnham? Admiral, if I may. The ideal outcome for any Klingon interaction is battle. They're relentlessly hostile, sir. It's in their nature."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"With respect, it would be unwise to confuse race and culture. Understood, Admiral."
1,1,GEORGIOU,COMPUTER,"Understood, Admiral. Signal terminated."
1,1,COMPUTER,GEORGIOU,Signal terminated. That went well. What's the mood outside?
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"There is a space station at Eagle Twelve, three light years away. The Andorian colony at Gamma-Hydra is six. Shenzhou is their only line of defense if the Klingons attack. Not if. When."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,Not if. When. I have to hope that whatever happens here can serve as a bridge between our civilisations.
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,I have to hope that whatever happens here can serve as a bridge between our civilisations. That's the diplomat in you talking. What does the soldier say?
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,That's the diplomat in you talking. What does the soldier say? Nothing good.
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,Is that a weapon? It seems to be some sort of signal emitter.
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,It seems to be some sort of signal emitter. Where are my filters?
1,1,GEORGIOU,DETMER,Where are my filters? Adjusting orientation to minimise dispersal.
1,1,DETMER,GEORGIOU,Adjusting orientation to minimise dispersal. Somebody turn it down.
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,All the way down. It's a signal pulse.
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,It's a signal pulse. Is there a message?
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Is there a message? This may be the message. Captain, what if they're calling for the same thing we are? Backup."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"This may be the message. Captain, what if they're calling for the same thing we are? Backup. Long-range sensors to the maximum, Saru. If more Klingons are on their way, I want as much notice as possible."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Long-range sensors to the maximum, Saru. If more Klingons are on their way, I want as much notice as possible. Permission to leave the bridge, Captain?"
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Permission to leave the bridge, Captain? Are you kidding?"
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,Are you kidding? It's relevant.
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"It's relevant. Granted. Ensign, get me a status report, deck by deck."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Granted. Ensign, get me a status report, deck by deck. Computer."
1,1,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,Computer. Working.
1,1,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,Working. Open dedicated subspace channel 222AA7.
1,1,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,Open dedicated subspace channel 222AA7. Use of this frequency requires diplomatic authorisation.
1,1,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,"Use of this frequency requires diplomatic authorisation. Voiceprint authorise. Burnham, Michael."
1,1,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,"Voiceprint authorise. Burnham, Michael. Confirmed."
1,1,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,"Confirmed. Hello, Sarek. I'm happy to see you."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Tell me. How did you keep the Klingons at bay? Engineering, report."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Engineering, report. Captain, we have to fire on them. Hit that ship with everything we've got."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Captain, we have to fire on them. Hit that ship with everything we've got. Absolutely not. They haven't powered weapons. They don't appear to pose an imminent threat."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,Absolutely not. They haven't powered weapons. They don't appear to pose an imminent threat. The Klingon threat is always imminent and inevitable.
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"The Klingon threat is always imminent and inevitable. Thank you, Mister Gant. I'd like to remind you, we're wildly outgunned."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Thank you, Mister Gant. I'd like to remind you, we're wildly outgunned. 240 years ago, near H'Atoria, a Vulcan ship crossed into Klingon space. The Klingons attacked immediately. They destroyed the vessel. Vulcans don't make the same mistake twice. From then on, until formal relations were established, whenever the Vulcans crossed paths with Klingons, the Vulcans fired first. They said hello in a language the Klingons understood. Violence brought respect. Respect brought peace. Captain, we have to give the Klingons a Vulcan hello."

1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"If their intention is to attack, balling up our fists won't dissuade them. It would be logical for you to take into account my success rate during our seven years together, and execute my plan without further challenge before we're dragged into war."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"It would be logical for you to take into account my success rate during our seven years together, and execute my plan without further challenge before we're dragged into war. Starfleet doesn't fire first. That's all, Number One."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Starfleet doesn't fire first. That's all, Number One. We have to."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"We have to. In my Ready room. Now. Lieutenant Commander, you have the Bridge."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Computer, privacy. Captain"
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,Captain How dare you challenge me?
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,How dare you challenge me? I apologise for my insubordination.
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,I apologise for my insubordination. Don't you realise that kind of talk can destabilise a crew?
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,Don't you realise that kind of talk can destabilise a crew? Don't underestimate them. I've overseen their exercises. They're ready for battle.
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Don't underestimate them. I've overseen their exercises. They're ready for battle. Battle is not a simulation. It's blood and screams and funerals. I taught you better than this. We don't start shooting on a hunch, and we don't take innocent lives. Period. I understand your history with the Klingons."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Battle is not a simulation. It's blood and screams and funerals. I taught you better than this. We don't start shooting on a hunch, and we don't take innocent lives. Period. I understand your history with the Klingons. My commitment to this course of action is not emotional. We target its neck, cut off its head"
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"My commitment to this course of action is not emotional. We target its neck, cut off its head You're still injured. You're not thinking clearly."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,You're still injured. You're not thinking clearly. Thousands of lives will be lost because of failure to act.
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,Thousands of lives will be lost because of failure to act. Whose lives? Victims of your imaginary war?
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Whose lives? Victims of your imaginary war? And your life, Captain. Yours."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"And your life, Captain. Yours. Stand down, Commander Burnham. That's an order."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Stand down, Commander Burnham. That's an order. You're right. I may not be myself."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"You're right. I may not be myself. Easy, Michael."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Easy, Michael. I'm sorry."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,Fire! Belay that order!
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Belay that order! Captain, please. I'm trying to save you. I'm trying to save all of you."
1,1,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Captain, please. I'm trying to save you. I'm trying to save all of you. Stand down."
1,1,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,Is it Starfleet? No. Those ships are Klingon.
1,2,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Hello, Michael. Welcome to the USS Shenzhou. And congratulations on your recent commencement. Respect is earned, as is friendliness."
1,2,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"This is hardly a negotiation. First contact, then. The only human to attend the Vulcan Learning Centre and Science Academy rejoins her own kind. You can see my analogy, more or less."
1,2,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"First contact, then. The only human to attend the Vulcan Learning Centre and Science Academy rejoins her own kind. You can see my analogy, more or less. Less."

1,2,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Not too shabby, huh? It appears to be functional."

1,2,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,Thank you Captain. How many Klingon vessels have entered the system?
1,2,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"How many Klingon vessels have entered the system? The Klingon High Council consists of 24 houses. That can't be a coincidence. The number of ships. It suggests that someone is attempting to unify the Empire again, against us."

1,2,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,Is the corridor outside the brig undamaged and still pressurised? Affirmative.
1,2,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,"Negative. Exposure to the vacuum of space for over fifteen seconds would result in respiratory distress, shock and suffocation before you are able to reach blast door.

1,2,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"I believed it was the only way to avoid a full-scale war. When you first came aboard seven years ago, I worried your Vulcan training might some day trump your humanity. Do you know why Sarek asked me to take you on? I was a human who had seen a life of loss but still chose hope. What an ego I had thinking I could pick away the shell the Vulcans put around you. I was so sure I could do it. Even convinced that you were ready for the Captain's chair. To think I knew you so little."

1,5,BURNHAM,TILLY,"The Tardigrade. Each time we use the spore drive, it gets weaker. You're stressed."
1,5,TILLY,BURNHAM,You're stressed. I barely have a job here. I've never been less busy.
1,5,BURNHAM,TILLY,I barely have a job here. I've never been less busy. But then that gives you the time and space to actually process what you're going through emotionally.
1,5,TILLY,BURNHAM,But then that gives you the time and space to actually process what you're going through emotionally. I don't like it.
1,5,BURNHAM,TILLY,I don't like it. Really? I love feeling feelings.
1,5,TILLY,CORNWELL,Really? I love feeling feelings. Sorry. I didn't know you were still in here.
1,5,CORNWELL,COMPUTER,I'm your friend. Warning. Incoming warp signature detected. Klingon class D7 battle cruiser identified. Tractor beam engaged.
1,5,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,Warning. Incoming warp signature detected. Klingon class D7 battle cruiser identified. Tractor beam engaged. I came to speak to Captain Lorca.
1,5,BURNHAM,AIRIAM,"I came to speak to Captain Lorca. Yes, sir."
1,5,AIRIAM,BURNHAM,"Yes, sir. Multiple jumps?"
1,5,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,"Yes, sir. Working."
1,5,BURNHAM,L'RELL,"Let's do it. Have you ever been tortured, Captain?"
1,5,L'RELL,OWOSEKUN,"Perhaps you realise glory must be earned through sacrifice and pain. Lieutenant Stamets has taken the spore drive offline, sir."
1,5,OWOSEKUN,TILLY,"Lieutenant Stamets has taken the spore drive offline, sir. I had the computer run all known life forms in the Federation database. Should I try to access the classified database at the Daystrom Institute?"
1,5,TILLY,BURNHAM,"I had the computer run all known life forms in the Federation database. Should I try to access the classified database at the Daystrom Institute? So far, we found one viable workaround. This hypospray contains Tardigrade DNA and replication catalysts that will initiate rapid horizontal gene transfer in a host. The interface process requires an evolved organism, a species with a highly functioning nervous system. And one that, like the Tardigrade, shares genetic information with mushrooms. The animal kingdom may have diverted from its fungal counterparts 600 million years ago, but Homo Sapiens still share over half of our DNA with them."
1,5,BURNHAM,AIRIAM,"Captain Saru, I understand that you are upset. You're in command. It's a time of crisis. And your culture trains you to be on the heightened lookout for enemies. But I assure you, I'm not one of them. Aye, sir."
1,5,AIRIAM,OWOSEKUN,"Aye, sir. Point-seven AUs from our position, bearing 13 mark 59."
1,5,OWOSEKUN,L'RELL,"Point-seven AUs from our position, bearing 13 mark 59. Did you really think you could leave me? After all we've been through."
1,5,L'RELL,DETMER,"Did you really think you could leave me? After all we've been through. Klingon Raiders, sir. Five ships and counting, heading right towards us."
1,5,DETMER,OWOSEKUN,"Klingon Raiders, sir. Five ships and counting, heading right towards us. We must've been spotted, sir."
1,5,BURNHAM,TILLY,Of course. May the sun and moon watch your comings and goings in the endless nights and days that are before you. Are you sure this will work?
1,5,TILLY,BURNHAM,"May the sun and moon watch your comings and goings in the endless nights and days that are before you. Are you sure this will work? No. But if this is its response to an adverse environment, what does it consider to be hospitable? This creature has traveled to the ends of the universe. My hope is that what makes it most happy is to be free."
1,5,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,"No. But if this is its response to an adverse environment, what does it consider to be hospitable? This creature has traveled to the ends of the universe. My hope is that what makes it most happy is to be free. Initiating performance review, Acting Captain Saru. Protocol cancelled."
1,6,BURNHAM,TILLY,Two more laps before breakfast. We've done ten.
1,6,TILLY,BURNHAM,We've done ten. You still need to shave six point five seconds off of your time.
1,6,BURNHAM,TILLY,You still need to shave six point five seconds off of your time. Does six seconds really matter?
1,6,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Does six seconds really matter? Six point five. And yes, they matter, if you're ever gonna make Captain."
1,6,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Six point five. And yes, they matter, if you're ever gonna make Captain. It's been my experience that what I lack in athletic ability I more than make up for in intelligence and personality. We may want to focus on those attributes."
1,6,TILLY,BURNHAM,It's been my experience that what I lack in athletic ability I more than make up for in intelligence and personality. We may want to focus on those attributes. Everyone applying to the Command Training Programme will be smart. Personality doesn't count.
1,6,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Everyone applying to the Command Training Programme will be smart. Personality doesn't count. That's just something people with no personality say. Wait, which in no way means you. You absolutely have a personality."
1,6,TILLY,BURNHAM,"That's just something people with no personality say. Wait, which in no way means you. You absolutely have a personality. Six point five seconds is not an arbitrary number. Your new time will earn you a physical endurance commendation. Today, your goal is six point five seconds. Then, getting a transfer on a Constitution-class, like the Enterprise. After that, First Officer track. See your path, stay on it, reach your destination. Cadet to Captain, just like that. What's it going to be, Tilly?"

1,6,COMPUTER,TILLY,"Two survivors. One injury. Mission success. Hologram battle simulation complete. Computer, green juice. Extra green."

1,6,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Computer, cancel that order. That's hardly the correct ratio of protein, carbohydrates, and fat. Computer, three egg white breakfast burrito with black beans. Computer"
1,6,TILLY,BURNHAM,Computer Make it two.
1,6,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Make it two. Computer, add salsa."
1,6,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Computer, add salsa. Computer, add roasted tomato salsa. Cooked tomatoes are a great source of lycopene. Remember that."
1,6,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Computer, add roasted tomato salsa. Cooked tomatoes are a great source of lycopene. Remember that. Oh my God, you are so scary."
1,6,TILLY,COMPUTER,"Oh my God, you are so scary. Two appetising and nutrient-filled burritos."
1,6,TILLY,BURNHAM,"I'm Cadet Sylvia Tilly. Er, this is my mentor, Michael. The same. You probably can believe everything you hear."
1,6,BURNHAM,TILLY,"The same. You probably can believe everything you hear. Crazy kids. Michael. Michael, what's wrong?"
1,6,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Crazy kids. Michael. Michael, what's wrong? I should go."
1,6,BURNHAM,AMANDA,Sarek. We can't let them do this to her. She has worked her whole life for this. She's excelled. You have to do something. This is not fair.
1,6,AMANDA,BURNHAM,"Nonsense. Sarek, make her see the truth. You brought me here."
1,6,TILLY,BURNHAM,It's like a Vulcan soul. I was raised as one. After my parents were killed at a Vulcan outpost
1,6,BURNHAM,TILLY,"As long as I don't overstay my welcome, the shuttle shields can handle it, but I need someone to work the neural enhancer. I'd like Cadet Tilly. She's smart, and I could use the moral support. Sir."
1,6,CORNWELL,TILLY,"I came to see my friend. Hey, where's that old Burnham bluster, huh? The bad-ass lady who's always pushing me to be the best I can be? Do you know what helps me when I'm freaked out? Talking."
1,6,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Then how do I know if I should pull you out? Don't. No matter what the sensors say, you leave me in there. Okay? Go."
1,6,BURNHAM,AMANDA,"Don't. No matter what the sensors say, you leave me in there. Okay? Go. Do you remember, on your tenth birthday we took a shuttle and we went to the seventh moon of Eridani D?"
1,6,AMANDA,BURNHAM,Listen to me. Why are you doing this?
1,6,BURNHAM,TILLY,You're near death. I can help you like you helped me. Give me a chance. Please. I don't know.
1,6,TILLY,CORNWELL,"Damn it. Fine. Nothing like a single malt, straight from the motherland. I still think about the bottle we killed that night we went to see the Perseids meteor shower. You don't remember?"
1,6,CORNWELL,BURNHAM,"Less than a week ago, you were being tortured. Now you're back in the chair. How do you feel about that? No, you're not."
1,6,BURNHAM,TILLY,I said I'm not leaving here without Sarek. Hey.
1,6,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Hey. Sarek keeps blocking me. I can't fight you, too."
1,6,BURNHAM,CORNWELL,"My thoughts to your thoughts. Wake up, Sarek. Tell us where you are. You sleep with a phaser in your bed, and you say nothing's wrong?"
1,6,BURNHAM,CORNWELL,"You can do better. But I won't push you. We'll have this conversation one day, Father. I don't wanna ruin your career. But when I return, we'll talk about how you step down. And after you get some help, maybe we'll get you back in that chair."
1,6,CORNWELL,TILLY,"I don't wanna ruin your career. But when I return, we'll talk about how you step down. And after you get some help, maybe we'll get you back in that chair. Shaving off my time."
1,6,TILLY,BURNHAM,Shaving off my time. I gave you bad advice. There are a million ways to get to the Captain's chair. Find your own.
1,6,BURNHAM,TILLY,I gave you bad advice. There are a million ways to get to the Captain's chair. Find your own. I have.
1,6,TILLY,COMPUTER,"I have. Green tea. Exceptional source of antioxidants, alkaloids, and amino acids."

1,7,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,"Yes, Captain Mudd. Tilly, where are you?"
1,7,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Tilly, where are you? So, did I die, too?"
1,7,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Oh, okay. Er, er, I got something. Yeah, I'm sending it to you right now. Poor thing. No wonder you feel bad. Mudd hid the ship inside the creature and the crystal inside the ship. This crystal, it has the same orthogonal indices as the device on Mudd's wrist."
1,7,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Poor thing. No wonder you feel bad. Mudd hid the ship inside the creature and the crystal inside the ship. This crystal, it has the same orthogonal indices as the device on Mudd's wrist. Can we beam it over to the deck and try to figure out a way to disable it?"
1,7,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Can we beam it over to the deck and try to figure out a way to disable it? No, because Mudd has control of all the critical systems, and we're running out of time. Now that Mudd knows how to work the spore drive, the only way is to get Mudd to reset time himself."
1,7,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,Are you done? Coordinates sent.
1,7,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,"Coordinates sent. The Klingons will pay a lot to win this war, but there is one thing they would pay more for."
1,7,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,"I'm not an officer. I'm Michael Burnham. Identity confirmed. Captain Mudd, the alien ship is hailing."
1,7,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,"Identity confirmed. Captain Mudd, the alien ship is hailing. You'll get a lot of money for this ship, but what would I be worth to them?"
1,7,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,Not for long. Captain Mudd.
1,7,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,We are being hailed by the Klingons. Lieutenant Stamets has shown us your success is a universal certainty.
1,7,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,As am I. You win. Working.
1,7,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,Acknowledged. Two to beam aboard. You seem very happy.
1,7,COMPUTER,STELLA,Denied. Harcourt. Where have you been? I have been so worried about you.
1,8,DETMER,OWOSEKUN,"Acknowledged. Negative, sir. I have power signatures that are off the charts, but our sensors can't seem to isolate the individual ships when they have those invisibility screens up."
1,8,OWOSEKUN,DETMER,"Shields holding at thirty two percent. Two Birds-of-Prey approaching, sir."
1,8,DETMER,COMPUTER,"Aye, sir. Black alert. Black alert."
1,8,COMPUTER,TILLY,Black alert. Black alert. Lieutenant?
1,8,TILLY,AIRIAM,"Aye, Captain. Spore drive ready. Aye, Captain."
1,8,AIRIAM,TILLY,"Aye, Captain. Feel all right, Lieutenant?"
1,8,TILLY,BURNHAM,"No, sir. I'm sorry, I didn't, er, mean to... You've been setting an accelerated pace since we got here. It's unfortunate that the transmitter's interference meant we had to beam down thirty kilometres away, but look around, it could be worse."
1,8,BURNHAM,L'RELL,"It's not registering as a lifeform, sir. According to this, it's actually not distinguishable from the rest of the forest. General Kol."
1,8,L'RELL,BURNHAM,My skills as an interrogator. My spies tell me you have a prisoner who refuses to speak. Universal translator's got nothing.
1,8,BURNHAM,L'RELL,"No. Order 1 restricts us from revealing ourselves to sentient beings that aren't warp-capable. We're well beyond that. Now our duty is to follow First Contact protocol, and we can't borrow or alter their property without them understanding our objective and agreeing to it. Scream. I said, scream."
1,8,L'RELL,CORNWELL,"Scream. I said, scream. No."
1,8,CORNWELL,L'RELL,No. Good. You were convincing. The guard is gone. Now we can talk.
1,8,BURNHAM,TILLY,Or the one? Okay. What is going on with you?
1,8,TILLY,L'RELL,"Okay. We'll monitor these episodes. Hopefully, they'll pass, right? You don't seem reassured. Usually I'm pretty good at providing that. That's kind of my thing. What happens to those who Starfleet captures?"
1,8,L'RELL,CORNWELL,"What happens to those who Starfleet captures? In war? They're imprisoned, interrogated humanely. Eventually, they're returned to their people as part of any final peace settlement."
1,8,CORNWELL,L'RELL,"In war? They're imprisoned, interrogated humanely. Eventually, they're returned to their people as part of any final peace settlement. So you do not execute them."
1,8,L'RELL,CORNWELL,So you do not execute them. The Federation has no death penalty.
1,8,CORNWELL,L'RELL,My ship? Discovery. I know its shuttle delivered you to the trap on Cancri IV.
1,8,L'RELL,CORNWELL,Discovery. I know its shuttle delivered you to the trap on Cancri IV. Why should I trust you?
1,8,CORNWELL,L'RELL,"Why should I trust you? Because we need each other, Admiral. And what other option do you have?"
1,8,L'RELL,BURNHAM,"Because we need each other, Admiral. And what other option do you have? How far did you get?"
1,8,BURNHAM,CORNWELL,What about Saru? Certain we can get to your ship undetected?
1,8,L'RELL,CORNWELL,You're not what I expected. Neither are you.
1,8,CORNWELL,L'RELL,"Neither are you. At least you won't die in a cage, Admiral."
1,8,L'RELL,BURNHAM,"She took my blade and tried to escape. I will dispose of the body. Come on, come on, come on."
1,8,BURNHAM,L'RELL,Yes. Grafk. Torath. Silrek.
1,8,L'RELL,BURNHAM,"Grafk. Torath. Silrek. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Yeah. Michael Burnham to Discovery. Discovery, do you read me?"
1,8,BURNHAM,L'RELL,"You weren't yourself. Before her escape, the human confirmed that Discovery possesses a powerful technology. Were it replicated, your conquest could reach far beyond the limits of our Empire."
1,8,L'RELL,BURNHAM,"My Lord, I would be honoured to serve you. I thought it was, sir. The Pahvans repaired our signal inhibitor after Saru destroyed it. I watched it happen."
1,9,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Yes, Captain. Currently We suspect the Klingon cloak generates a massive gravitational field, one that bends light and other electromagnetic waves around the ship."
1,9,TILLY,COMPUTER,"Oh my God, oh my God, I'm sorry. I just assumed... CULBER No, it's okay, Tilly. I'm sure the Lieutenant has a good explanation for keeping that a secret. Black alert."

1,9,BURNHAM,CORNWELL,"Admiral, I'm Specialist Burnham. Can you move? I can't feel my legs."
1,9,CORNWELL,BURNHAM,I can't feel my legs. Tyler.
1,9,CORNWELL,BURNHAM,"State your mission, Specialist Burnham. Captain Lorca dispatched us to install sensors aboard this ship so we could break the Klingon cloak."
1,9,BURNHAM,CORNWELL,I have to make it to the Bridge. You're leaving me?
1,9,CORNWELL,BURNHAM,"You're leaving me? I don't have a choice. Here. (gives her a phaser) Discovery'll beam us out when the time comes. Tyler, can you hear me? I'm gonna see this mission through. I meant what I said. Everybody comes home."
1,9,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,"I don't have a choice. Here. (gives her a phaser) Discovery'll beam us out when the time comes. Tyler, can you hear me? I'm gonna see this mission through. I meant what I said. Everybody comes home. Uplink to Discovery established."

1,9,TILLY,CORNWELL,"Ninety six more. Tyler, you need to focus on my voice. You're safe. Burnham will return shortly. What you are experiencing are the effects of past trauma. I know it doesn't feel like that, believe me. What you're seeing is just a memory. You are right here with me."
1,9,CORNWELL,TILLY,"They didn't break you then, so they are not gonna break you now. Normal breath in, slow breath out. Good. Keep that up. Jump 59. Jump 60. Jump 61. Jump 62."
1,9,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Jump 65. General Kol, I wish to talk."
1,9,BURNHAM,CORNWELL,"Because I was here. I'm the one who killed T'Kuvma. Lieutenant, we're about to have company. Tyler, there's only so much I can do when I can't move my legs."
1,9,CORNWELL,BURNHAM,"For the love of God, get up. Burnham is in danger and she needs your help. Her name was Captain Philippa Georgiou. I regret that my actions that day have locked our people into this war."
1,9,BURNHAM,TILLY,"If you are to capture me, then prove your worth. T'Kuvma defeated the woman whom that belonged to. Do me the same honour. Three, two, one."
1,9,TILLY,AIRIAM,"Three, two, one. Jump protocol complete."
1,9,AIRIAM,DETMER,Jump protocol complete. We're sitting ducks.
1,9,DETMER,OWOSEKUN,"We're sitting ducks. Captain, I suggest jumping to safety until the cloak has been penetrated."
1,9,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"Captain, I suggest jumping to safety until the cloak has been penetrated. No, it's not. And neither is this."
1,9,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,"No, it's not. And neither is this. Transmission ended."
1,9,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,Transmission ended. Doctor Culber.
1,9,BURNHAM,L'RELL,"No. I'm glad you're here, too. You get to live your life the way you deserve to. Not at war but at peace. Do not worry. I will never let them hurt you."
1,9,L'RELL,COMPUTER,Do not worry. I will never let them hurt you. Command stations. Command stations.
1,9,COMPUTER,L'RELL,Command stations. Command stations. Soon.
1,9,L'RELL,TILLY,Soon. The computer is reading it as an incomplete navigation sequence.
1,10,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,"Yellow alert. Blast scoring and damage patterns are consistent with Federation weapons, but the hull signatures are a little off."
1,10,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Wreckage is Klingon, but hull density analysis is registering outside acceptable margins. Captain? A vessel is approaching at sub-light speed."
1,10,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,Captain? A vessel is approaching at sub-light speed. They must have registered an active Klingon ship somewhere nearby.
1,10,BURNHAM,TILLY,Vulcan rebels? Firing on Starfleet? Lieutenant Stamets is non-responsive.
1,10,TILLY,BURNHAM,Lieutenant Stamets is non-responsive. That's not possible. All matter native to our universe resonates with the same quantum signature. Nothing can change it.
1,10,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Yes, sir. And some good old-fashioned human know-how, Lieutenant."
1,10,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,"Proceed with extreme caution, Lieutenant. Even the slightest nick could corrupt the data or destroy the core completely. Debris surface analysis is non-conclusive."
1,10,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,Debris surface analysis is non-conclusive. Sir?
1,10,BURNHAM,L'RELL,"Yes, sir. What are you doing, standing there?"

1,10,BURNHAM,TILLY,Duty calls. The data core from the Klingon vessel. I got it open.
1,10,TILLY,BURNHAM,"The data core from the Klingon vessel. I got it open. Well done, Tilly. Strange. The core itself is Klingon, but these data chips are of Vulcan design. They should be compatible with our universal interface. But this fused data technology, and their sharing of ships... Is it possible that in this universe, the Vulcans, Andorians and Klingons have some sort of alliance?"

1,10,TILLY,BURNHAM,Allied against... against us? I'm gonna get into the interface and try to figure this out.
1,10,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Theoretically, yes. Wow."
1,10,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Wow. The Terrans appear to be the antithesis of us, in every way. They're an oppressive, racist, xenophobic culture that dominates all known space, and they're ruled by a faceless emperor."
1,10,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Belay that. I'm sorry, but you can't take it, sir. I'm examining the crew manifest of mirror Discovery. You're not its Captain. That er, that's me. That's me."

1,10,BURNHAM,TILLY,"I don't know who you are over here just yet, so conceal your voice just in case. Long live the Empire!"
1,10,TILLY,BURNHAM,That's not... that's not possible. It's more than possible. Your nicknames include The Slayer of Sorna Prime.
1,10,TILLY,BURNHAM,"I'd say, er, I'm 60% excited, 40% terrified. Actually, it's 60% terrified, 40% excited. Maybe it's 70% Tilly."
1,10,BURNHAM,TILLY,Tilly. Sorry. Sorry.
1,10,TILLY,BURNHAM,Sorry. Sorry. And stop apologising. Terrans don't apologise.
1,10,BURNHAM,TILLY,"And stop apologising. Terrans don't apologise. Well, my mother would definitely approve. Computer, cancel mirror."
1,10,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Well, my mother would definitely approve. Computer, cancel mirror. You are a captain now."
1,10,BURNHAM,TILLY,"You are a captain now. No, I'm not. She is. I'm nothing like her, Michael. She's terrifying. She's... she's like a twisted version of everything I've ever aspired to be. I'm gonna have nightmares about myself now."
1,10,TILLY,BURNHAM,"No, I'm not. She is. I'm nothing like her, Michael. She's terrifying. She's... she's like a twisted version of everything I've ever aspired to be. I'm gonna have nightmares about myself now. You don't actually have to be her."
1,10,BURNHAM,TILLY,You don't actually have to be her. But how do I project that strength?
1,10,TILLY,BURNHAM,"But how do I project that strength? I've been trying to understand them better. And Terran strength is born out of pure necessity, because they live in constant fear, always looking for the next knife aimed at their back. Their strength is painted rust. It's a facade. But you have the strength of an entire crew that believes in you. Fortify yourself with our faith in you. That's what a real Captain does."

1,10,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Then bring her to me. Is that how you treat your long-lost Captain? If you greeted me that way, Connor, I'd cut out your tongue and use it to lick my boots."
1,10,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Is that how you treat your long-lost Captain? If you greeted me that way, Connor, I'd cut out your tongue and use it to lick my boots. Be sure that you do."
1,10,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,Be sure that you do. Incoming warp signature. ISS Shenzhou approaching.
1,10,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,Incoming warp signature. ISS Shenzhou approaching. My God.
1,10,BURNHAM,TILLY,"My God. Open a channel. Inform Shenzhou, three to beam over."
1,10,TILLY,BURNHAM,"I won't let you down, sir. Clear, Captain."
1,10,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Glad to hear it. The chair is yours, Captain."
1,11,HARRINGTON,BURNHAM,Hold on a minute. What is your name?
1,11,BURNHAM,DETMER,"What is your name? You are all guilty of malicious thoughts against your Emperor. By order of the sovereign Terran Empire, I hereby sentence you to death."
1,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,"You are all guilty of malicious thoughts against your Emperor. By order of the sovereign Terran Empire, I hereby sentence you to death. Which is exactly what I feared the most."
1,11,BURNHAM,TILLY,"No, I haven't, Saru. I'm sorry. Culber was her friend and colleague. She deserves to know the truth."
1,11,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Terran General Order Four. Any exotic species deemed a threat to the Imperial Supremacy will be extinguished without prejudice. Tactical, prep photon torpedoes for launch."
1,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Tactical, prep photon torpedoes for launch. Do not anticipate me, Number One."
1,11,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Do not anticipate me, Number One. Captain, we have our orders."
1,11,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Have it analysed immediately. It contains the data we need to bring the rebellion to its knees. Tell Tactical now is the time to prep those torpedoes, but I'll give the order to fire weapons at my discretion. My apologies, Captain."
1,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,"My apologies, Captain. I'll be in quarters. Tyler, you're with me."
1,11,TILLY,COMPUTER,"Please, Saru. Order them to stand down. Access granted."
1,11,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,"Access granted. Tell me the truth, right now. What is happening to you?"
1,11,BURNHAM,DETMER,I didn't testify to that. It's you. You were there on that bridge. I remember. Captain.
1,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,Captain. I'm fine.
1,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Officer Ash Tyler, you are guilty of the attempted murder of an Imperial Captain. By order of the sovereign Terran Empire, I hereby sentence you to death. Your prisoner, Captain. Do you have anything to say for yourself?"
1,12,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,Haven't you ever been afraid of a ghost? Warp drive disengaged. Imperial Palace secure perimeter detected.
1,12,TILLY,GEORGIOU,"Are you in there, Lieutenant? Are you in there? Captain Burnham. A face I thought I'd never see again in the flesh. Choose one. You should know what you're looking for in a Kelpien."
1,12,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,Captain Burnham. A face I thought I'd never see again in the flesh. Choose one. You should know what you're looking for in a Kelpien. That one.
1,12,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,That one. You brought us a gift.
1,12,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"You brought us a gift. Captain Gabriel Lorca, delivered to the Emperor's justice. And long overdue."
1,12,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Captain Gabriel Lorca, delivered to the Emperor's justice. And long overdue. Your life will be long, Gabriel, and every single moment of it will be spent in our agonisers. A fair price to pay for your vaulting ambition."
1,12,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"The food is delicious, as always. No one prepares Kelpien like the Imperial chef. Here, have my ganglia. You deserve a treat."
1,12,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"No one prepares Kelpien like the Imperial chef. Here, have my ganglia. You deserve a treat. You're too generous."
1,12,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"You're too generous. Why would you leave me, then? I gave you everything. Best education, riches beyond imagination, even your own ship."
1,12,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Why would you leave me, then? I gave you everything. Best education, riches beyond imagination, even your own ship. I earned my command on the Shenzhou."
1,12,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,I earned my command on the Shenzhou. You were hesitant to use it back at Harlak. Those rebels could have escaped. I had to dispatch them myself.
1,12,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,You were hesitant to use it back at Harlak. Those rebels could have escaped. I had to dispatch them myself. I had it under control.
1,12,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,I had it under control. You've grown soft.
1,12,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"You've grown soft. And you've grown cruel. If you miss me, then say it. Otherwise, let me be."
1,12,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"And you've grown cruel. If you miss me, then say it. Otherwise, let me be. I thought you were dead."
1,12,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Never could tell when you were lying to me. Fortunately, this time I know. (draws a dagger) You always tried to outsmart me, Michael, even as a child. Why? Was it the loss of your parents? My attention to the Empire? Or were you just built that way? Why were you never satisfied? I knew you had become Lorca's collaborator, and you were conspiring to kill me and take my throne. Why did the two of you come back here? Please, Philippa."
1,12,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Please, Philippa. It's Philippa now? Not so long ago, it was Mother. Guards! Take her to the throne room. Gather my council. She is to be executed by my own hand for treason."
1,12,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Captain Michael Burnham. We have sentenced you to death for crimes committed against the Terran throne. Do you have any last words before we collect our retribution? At least you are showing some steel. I do love you, Michael. I would never grant anyone else in the Empire the mercy of a quick death. You don't love me. You don't love me because you don't know me. Before today, you and I have never met. I am Michael Burnham, but I am not your Michael Burnham. I'm from another universe. I have proof. It's in my pocket."
1,12,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"You don't love me. You don't love me because you don't know me. Before today, you and I have never met. I am Michael Burnham, but I am not your Michael Burnham. I'm from another universe. I have proof. It's in my pocket. Lord Eling, retrieve this proof."
1,12,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Lord Eling, retrieve this proof. That piece of metal contains the quantum variance from my world. It's subtle, but it's there. There's absolutely no way to fake it. It belonged to my Captain. It belonged to you. Our bond, it seems, is strong enough to cross universes."
1,12,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"That piece of metal contains the quantum variance from my world. It's subtle, but it's there. There's absolutely no way to fake it. It belonged to my Captain. It belonged to you. Our bond, it seems, is strong enough to cross universes. What a quaint concept. Parallel universes."
1,12,GEORGIOU,L'RELL,"This is from the United Federation of Planets, and apparently, so are you. You must want something."
1,12,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Emperor, my ship and crew are here by accident. All we want is to return to our universe, but we need your help to do that. You're interlopers from an alien army. What reason from any universe would I have to help you?"
1,12,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"You're interlopers from an alien army. What reason from any universe would I have to help you? Because you care for Burnham. Despite her betrayal, you said you loved her."
1,12,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Because you care for Burnham. Despite her betrayal, you said you loved her. Your people are dangerous. The Federation. I know it well from the Defiant's files. There is a reason why they're classified. Equality. Freedom. Cooperation."
1,12,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,Your people are dangerous. The Federation. I know it well from the Defiant's files. There is a reason why they're classified. Equality. Freedom. Cooperation. Cornerstones for successful cultures.
1,12,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Cornerstones for successful cultures. Delusions that Terrans shed millennia ago. Destructive ideals that fuel rebellions, and I will not let you infect us again."
1,12,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Delusions that Terrans shed millennia ago. Destructive ideals that fuel rebellions, and I will not let you infect us again. We just need access to the redacted information about the Defiant. We believe that it'll help us get back. Share it, and you have my word you'll never hear from us again."
1,12,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"We just need access to the redacted information about the Defiant. We believe that it'll help us get back. Share it, and you have my word you'll never hear from us again. Those documents will not help you. The Defiant crossed here through interphasic space, which not only resulted in a temporal anomaly, but also had devastating cognitive effects on every crew member. They went insane. They tore each other apart. I'm surprised the same thing didn't happen to your crew."
1,12,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Those documents will not help you. The Defiant crossed here through interphasic space, which not only resulted in a temporal anomaly, but also had devastating cognitive effects on every crew member. They went insane. They tore each other apart. I'm surprised the same thing didn't happen to your crew. We arrived here a different way."
1,12,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,We arrived here a different way. How?
1,12,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,How? An engine malfunction.
1,12,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,An engine malfunction. Warp engines do not breach the barriers between universes. Tell me what powers your ship.
1,12,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,Warp engines do not breach the barriers between universes. Tell me what powers your ship. Our ship jumped here with its displacement-activated spore hub drive.
1,12,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,Our ship jumped here with its displacement-activated spore hub drive. I would like to see this technology. Let's make an exchange. Your engine schematics for your freedom.
1,12,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"I would like to see this technology. Let's make an exchange. Your engine schematics for your freedom. If I agree, how do I know you'll let us go?"
1,12,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"If I agree, how do I know you'll let us go? Was your Georgiou a woman of honour?"
1,12,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,Was your Georgiou a woman of honour? Entirely.
1,12,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,Entirely. Then you have no reason to believe I am not as well.
1,12,GEORGIOU,L'RELL,Then you have no reason to believe I am not as well. No.
1,12,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"I'm sending you the coordinates to the Emperor's ship now. We'll see you soon. The Federation, through and through. They would never abandon you and your Captain. Rules to live by. Rules to die by."
1,12,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"I don't understand. When I adopted you, you gained a mother. But despite my constant guidance and affection, something was still missing. In Lorca, you saw a father, until you grew up and it became more."
1,12,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"When I adopted you, you gained a mother. But despite my constant guidance and affection, something was still missing. In Lorca, you saw a father, until you grew up and it became more. You're saying Lorca and I...?"
1,12,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,You're sensitive to light. Only compared to a human from your universe. It's the singular biological difference between our two races.
1,13,TILLY,AIRIAM,"Without a fresh supply of spores, it'll only get worse. As they did on Harlak."
1,13,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Emergency transport! Burnham to Discovery. Do you copy? Come in, Discovery. Burnham to Discovery. Do you copy? Come in. Discovery, do you copy? Come in. Please come in."
1,13,TILLY,BURNHAM,How? Lorca's staging a coup against the Emperor. You have to abort coming to the palace ship. Get as far away as you can.
1,13,BURNHAM,TILLY,How do we stop it? We're running simulations to account for energy dispersal.
1,13,TILLY,BURNHAM,We're running simulations to account for energy dispersal. But?
1,13,BURNHAM,TILLY,But? There's a containment field protecting the orb. Our weapons can't penetrate it.
1,13,TILLY,BURNHAM,"There's a containment field protecting the orb. Our weapons can't penetrate it. Leave the containment field to me. Stay at warp, so you can't be boarded, and I'll find a way to signal you when I'm in place. Be ready to blow up the reactor when I do. Burnham out."
1,13,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,The only thing I was blinded by was you. How did you find me? My bracelet makes my life signs undetectable.
1,13,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"How did you find me? My bracelet makes my life signs undetectable. This is your sanctuary. Considering the situation, it made sense you'd come here."
1,13,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"This is your sanctuary. Considering the situation, it made sense you'd come here. I should have known. Lorca seduced you, too."
1,13,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"I should have known. Lorca seduced you, too. Why would you say that?"
1,13,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"This belonged to my Michael. Now Lorca has taken everything from me. You lost a daughter, an empire. I lost a Captain, and a life. Both versions of me betrayed both versions of you. I won't let that happen again. And I won't let you die again."
1,13,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"You lost a daughter, an empire. I lost a Captain, and a life. Both versions of me betrayed both versions of you. I won't let that happen again. And I won't let you die again. So that's what happened to me on your side."
1,13,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,So that's what happened to me on your side. I'm gonna stop Lorca.
1,13,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,What is your plan? I have to disable the orb's containment field.
1,13,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,I have to disable the orb's containment field. Those controls are in the throne room. How will you get to them?
1,13,TILLY,AIRIAM,Even a blast from our photon torpedoes won't be enough to free it. What do we have that harnesses that kind of power?
1,13,AIRIAM,OWOSEKUN,What do we have that harnesses that kind of power? And how much of our spore supply would we need to use?
1,13,OWOSEKUN,DETMER,And how much of our spore supply would we need to use? I don't think we could outmanouvre a blast like that if we're that close.
1,13,DETMER,TILLY,"I don't think we could outmanouvre a blast like that if we're that close. Er, I just ran the simulations. Discovery's shields aren't strong enough to protect us from the energy wave that will be released when the network is freed. The shock wave will incinerate us. I don't think we can make it out alive."
1,13,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Er, I just ran the simulations. Discovery's shields aren't strong enough to protect us from the energy wave that will be released when the network is freed. The shock wave will incinerate us. I don't think we can make it out alive. I won't let another crew die on my watch, Gabriel. I've been here long enough to know that if you want your claim to the throne to be legitimate, you have to execute the Emperor."
1,13,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"I think you know. In exchange for my crew, I offer you me. Let them leave safely and I'm yours. Like you said, my future is here. But know this. I'm offering you my mind, nothing more. No. I'm destined to kill you."
1,13,GEORGIOU,TILLY,No. I'm destined to kill you. The Captain was right.
1,13,TILLY,DETMER,"There will be infinite pathways opening up in front of you. That... that's gonna be really Yes, Captain."
1,13,DETMER,OWOSEKUN,"Yes, Captain. Aye, Captain."
1,13,OWOSEKUN,DETMER,"Aye, Captain. Yes, sir."
1,13,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Yes, sir. You won't."
1,13,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,We would've helped you get home if you had asked. That's who Starfleet is. That's who I am. That's why I won't kill you now. But I will!
1,13,GEORGIOU,OWOSEKUN,It was a good plan. Burnham did it. The containment field is down.
1,13,OWOSEKUN,GEORGIOU,"I can't get a lock, Captain. I'm working on it. You fought well. For a moment I thought I had her back with me."
1,13,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Lorca's troops. I will buy you some time. I am a defeated Emperor. They've seen my neck. I have no future now. But I will die on my feet as fitting my station. Go, Michael Burnham. Find a way home. Live. Burnham to Discovery."
1,13,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,Burnham to Discovery. I've got her.
1,13,OWOSEKUN,AIRIAM,"She's on board. Aye, Captain."
1,13,AIRIAM,COMPUTER,"Aye, Captain. Black alert. Black alert."
1,13,COMPUTER,OWOSEKUN,"Black alert. Black alert. The Terran ship is targeting us, sir."
1,13,OWOSEKUN,DETMER,"The Terran ship is targeting us, sir. Aye, Captain."
1,13,DETMER,TILLY,"Yes, sir. Ambient mycelial energy is interacting with the drive."
1,13,TILLY,AIRIAM,"Levels look good. Aye, Captain."
1,13,AIRIAM,OWOSEKUN,"Aye, Captain. Heat shields at maximum."
1,13,OWOSEKUN,GEORGIOU,Heat shields at maximum. What have you done to me?
1,14,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Emperor. On your knees, slave. This Kelpien is my captain. Sir, I can explain."
1,14,BURNHAM,POLLARD,"I'm sorry. I can't. By all assessments, the patient now presents as Ash Tyler. Adrenocorticotropic hormonal levels are normal. Cellular mitochondria counts are back within human range. I find no remaining evidence of Klingon aggression or muscular stamina."
1,14,OWOSEKUN,CORNWELL,"Captain, its shields are up. It... Its phasers are charged and targeting. Where's Captain Lorca?"
1,14,CORNWELL,BURNHAM,"Where's Captain Lorca? Sarek, please."
1,14,BURNHAM,CORNWELL,"Sarek, please. Stand down, Specialist. Now. Computer, initiate command-level override. Authorisation Admiral Katrina Cornwell, pi beta six."
1,14,CORNWELL,COMPUTER,"Stand down, Specialist. Now. Computer, initiate command-level override. Authorisation Admiral Katrina Cornwell, pi beta six. Override confirmed."
1,14,CORNWELL,BURNHAM,"From what you've told us about the Terran Empire, no Starfleet officer could survive that universe alone, so my Gabriel is dead. Lorca sidelined the most vital asset in our fleet. Now, with your return, we have disseminated your hard-earned, cloak-breaking algorithm to the front lines, which will neutralise the Klingons' ability to render their ships invisible. But our fear is it's too late. The war here has waged on for nine brutal months without it. Stardate 4789.6. Klingon vessels launch hypothermic charges at Kelfour VI, burning off their atmosphere and killing 11,000 civilians instantly. Stardate 4851.5. A cloaked raider tails the USS Saratoga into spacedock at Starbase 22, then ignites its antimatter supply in a suicide mission. Days later, similar assaults are carried out on bases 19 and 12, resulting in the loss of one-third of our fleet. Research outposts at the border colonies of Nivalla, Septra and Iridin have also been destroyed. The only children spared are now orphans. There's no pattern to these attacks. There's no logical progression to their targets. There's not even consistency of method."
1,14,BURNHAM,CORNWELL,There's no pattern to these attacks. There's no logical progression to their targets. There's not even consistency of method. Nearly 20% of former Federation space has been occupied. Discovery will jump to Starbase One immediately. All evidence of your recent journey will be classified and destroyed. We cannot risk the knowledge of this alternate universe leaving the confines of Discovery.
1,14,CORNWELL,BURNHAM,Nearly 20% of former Federation space has been occupied. Discovery will jump to Starbase One immediately. All evidence of your recent journey will be classified and destroyed. We cannot risk the knowledge of this alternate universe leaving the confines of Discovery. I don't understand.
1,14,BURNHAM,CORNWELL,I don't understand. Starbase One is our only remaining sanctuary. Can you jump us there?
1,14,CORNWELL,BURNHAM,"I'm afraid we have no choice. Saru, take the ship to warp as soon as possible. Admiral There's one more thing you need to know."
1,14,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Emperor, the Federation has questions. I need you to answer them. What kind of guest would I be if I refused such a simple request?"
1,14,GEORGIOU,CORNWELL,"What kind of guest would I be if I refused such a simple request? I'm told that, in your universe, your word is law. Here, we do things differently."
1,14,CORNWELL,GEORGIOU,"I'm told that, in your universe, your word is law. Here, we do things differently. I can see that."
1,14,GEORGIOU,CORNWELL,"I know that she is dead and I am not. But I will leave you to determine which of us has proved stronger. Specialist Burnham has assured us that your arrival in this universe is without motive, but your presence here remains complicated."
1,14,CORNWELL,GEORGIOU,"Specialist Burnham has assured us that your arrival in this universe is without motive, but your presence here remains complicated. The solution, however, is not. Send me home."
1,14,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"The solution, however, is not. Send me home. The Emperor narrowly escaped a violent revolution. She deserves political asylum."
1,14,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,The Emperor narrowly escaped a violent revolution. She deserves political asylum. I don't need your protection.
1,14,GEORGIOU,CORNWELL,"I don't need your protection. We have charted a course for Starbase One. You will be held there, humanely, until Command can determine a proper course of action."
1,14,CORNWELL,GEORGIOU,"We have charted a course for Starbase One. You will be held there, humanely, until Command can determine a proper course of action. So I am your prisoner."
1,14,GEORGIOU,CORNWELL,"So I am your prisoner. Look, Your Highness, or whatever you're called, I'll tell it to you straight. I'm not even sure we know how to send you home, and even if we did, we have a war to fight. I'm sorry. Like I said, you're our guest. Make yourself at home. (to Sarek) The resemblance is remarkable."
1,14,CORNWELL,TILLY,"Look, Your Highness, or whatever you're called, I'll tell it to you straight. I'm not even sure we know how to send you home, and even if we did, we have a war to fight. I'm sorry. Like I said, you're our guest. Make yourself at home. (to Sarek) The resemblance is remarkable. How could that possibly be true? Just eat. And talk, if you want to. I'm here."
1,14,TILLY,DETMER,"How could that possibly be true? Just eat. And talk, if you want to. I'm here. Welcome back."
1,14,DETMER,CORNWELL,"Welcome back. Well done, all."
1,14,CORNWELL,DETMER,"Detmer, drop us out of warp. Aye, Admiral."
1,14,DETMER,CORNWELL,"Aye, Admiral. Bring Starbase One on screen."
1,14,CORNWELL,OWOSEKUN,"Bring Starbase One on screen. Aye, Admiral."
1,14,OWOSEKUN,CORNWELL,"Aye, Admiral. No."
1,14,CORNWELL,OWOSEKUN,No. Enhancing image.
1,14,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,Enhancing image. That's a Klingon crest. House D'Ghor.
1,14,BURNHAM,CORNWELL,That's a Klingon crest. House D'Ghor. Scan for life signs. Now!
1,14,CORNWELL,OWOSEKUN,Scan for life signs. Now! - Complying. Sensing 274 Klingon life signs aboard.
1,14,OWOSEKUN,CORNWELL,- Complying. Sensing 274 Klingon life signs aboard. Federation life.
1,14,CORNWELL,OWOSEKUN,"Federation life. Er, negative, Admiral. There's nothing."
1,14,OWOSEKUN,CORNWELL,"Er, negative, Admiral. There's nothing. There were 80,000 souls on that base. A large contingent of our leadership and at least three starships. The Klingons are practically in Earth's backyard."
1,14,CORNWELL,OWOSEKUN,"There were 80,000 souls on that base. A large contingent of our leadership and at least three starships. The Klingons are practically in Earth's backyard. Captain, we're being scanned."
1,14,OWOSEKUN,DETMER,"Captain, we're being scanned. Yes, sir."
1,14,DETMER,CORNWELL,"Yes, sir. Maintain current course and speed. We will make contact with Command. What's left of them."
1,14,CORNWELL,L'RELL,Maintain current course and speed. We will make contact with Command. What's left of them. You live.
1,14,L'RELL,CORNWELL,"You live. And you've finally made it aboard the USS Discovery, though I suspect you've found the accommodations lacking."
1,14,CORNWELL,L'RELL,"And you've finally made it aboard the USS Discovery, though I suspect you've found the accommodations lacking. Even from a cage, Kahless hears my call."
1,14,L'RELL,CORNWELL,"Even from a cage, Kahless hears my call. I do not subscribe to your ideals. And yet, I feel as though you and I understand each other."
1,14,CORNWELL,L'RELL,"Your Great Houses are carving up Federation assets among their factions. A captured starbase bears the insignia of House D'Ghor, not of the Klingon Empire. Is that the kind of unity your messiah proclaimed? They think nothing of the collateral damage caused by their brutal attacks. They target civilians, hospitals, food convoys. They slaughter innocents and inspire terror across the quadrant. This is war, not a child's game with rules. We fight to preserve Klingon identity."
1,14,L'RELL,CORNWELL,"This is war, not a child's game with rules. We fight to preserve Klingon identity. No one is looking to destroy your culture. Our laws are founded in equality, freedom."
1,14,CORNWELL,L'RELL,"No one is looking to destroy your culture. Our laws are founded in equality, freedom. T'Kuvma taught us that the Federation cannot help itself. It seeks universal homogenisation and assimilation."
1,14,L'RELL,CORNWELL,"T'Kuvma taught us that the Federation cannot help itself. It seeks universal homogenisation and assimilation. T'Kuvma was an ignorant fool, and your people are moving closer and closer to my home planet. What are you looking for? More territory? Conditional surrender? I mean, your people won't even make demands. Why? How does this war end?"
1,14,CORNWELL,L'RELL,"T'Kuvma was an ignorant fool, and your people are moving closer and closer to my home planet. What are you looking for? More territory? Conditional surrender? I mean, your people won't even make demands. Why? How does this war end? It doesn't. Klingons have tasted your blood. Conquer us or we will never relent."
1,14,L'RELL,CORNWELL,It doesn't. Klingons have tasted your blood. Conquer us or we will never relent. Thank you.
1,14,CORNWELL,BURNHAM,Thank you. There's been a change of plans. Another Klingon attack. You'll have to stay on board Discovery a little while longer.
1,14,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,There's been a change of plans. Another Klingon attack. You'll have to stay on board Discovery a little while longer. It makes no difference. One cell in this universe is as good as another. You heard your Admiral.
1,14,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,It makes no difference. One cell in this universe is as good as another. You heard your Admiral. We mean you no harm. The Admiral was just
1,14,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,We mean you no harm. The Admiral was just Tell me about the Vulcan. There is a connection between the two of you.
1,14,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,Tell me about the Vulcan. There is a connection between the two of you. Why would you say that?
1,14,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"So you were orphaned here as well. Another echo of fate between our worlds. Your rule extends through every system in your galaxy. You've conquered places Starfleet hasn't even dared to explore. I see now that the time for peace has passed. I need you to tell me, how did you defeat the Klingon Empire? I started this war, and I need to finish it."
1,14,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Another echo of fate between our worlds. Your rule extends through every system in your galaxy. You've conquered places Starfleet hasn't even dared to explore. I see now that the time for peace has passed. I need you to tell me, how did you defeat the Klingon Empire? I started this war, and I need to finish it. Why did you bring me here? Truly."
1,14,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Why did you bring me here? Truly. I wanted to show you a place of morality, of hope."
1,14,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"I wanted to show you a place of morality, of hope. Let me tell you, daughter who is not my daughter. In truth, you wished to save me because you couldn't save her. This regret that you have for what you did, it weakens you."
1,14,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Let me tell you, daughter who is not my daughter. In truth, you wished to save me because you couldn't save her. This regret that you have for what you did, it weakens you. I feel it every day of my life."
1,14,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"I feel it every day of my life. The Klingons are like cancer cells, constantly dividing. To root them out, you must destroy the tumour at its source. How much do you know about Qo'noS?"
1,14,GEORGIOU,CORNWELL,"The Klingons are like cancer cells, constantly dividing. To root them out, you must destroy the tumour at its source. How much do you know about Qo'noS? I suppose I don't have to tell you it's the middle of the night."
1,14,CORNWELL,BURNHAM,I suppose I don't have to tell you it's the middle of the night. I have a proposal.
1,14,BURNHAM,CORNWELL,"I have a proposal. The Klingons are taking the fight to us. We need to take it to them, to Qo'noS."
1,14,CORNWELL,BURNHAM,Let's go over it again. Qo'noS is composed of a subterranean series of now dormant volcanoes. It is a planet of caves.
1,14,BURNHAM,CORNWELL,"And once we're in position within the cave system, we'll release our surveillance drone to collect the necessary tactical information. Good. Because I've assured Starfleet we can do this. And by we, I mean you. It's a good plan, Specialist. Well done."
1,14,CORNWELL,BURNHAM,"Good. Because I've assured Starfleet we can do this. And by we, I mean you. It's a good plan, Specialist. Well done. Thank you, Admiral."
1,14,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Thank you, Admiral. You're gonna terraform a moon? Your own research on the success of an organic mycelial harvest was indeterminable. I've studied your data myself"
1,14,TILLY,GEORGIOU,You're gonna terraform a moon? Your own research on the success of an organic mycelial harvest was indeterminable. I've studied your data myself Your child is lost.
1,14,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,Freedom. What evolving details?
1,14,BURNHAM,TILLY,Admiral Cornwell requested a status report. This is the last of the mycelial transport vessels. We will be able to launch by the time we reach Veda.
1,14,TILLY,BURNHAM,"This is the last of the mycelial transport vessels. We will be able to launch by the time we reach Veda. I just said goodbye to my father, and it felt different. Final. It won't be, right?"
1,14,BURNHAM,TILLY,"I just said goodbye to my father, and it felt different. Final. It won't be, right? Did you ever think when you signed up for Starfleet, that you'd be forced to see war and death?"
1,14,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Did you ever think when you signed up for Starfleet, that you'd be forced to see war and death? Death found me when I was a child. So, yeah, I knew what I was getting into."
1,14,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Death found me when I was a child. So, yeah, I knew what I was getting into. I don't think I did. Not really. Does that make me naive?"
1,14,TILLY,BURNHAM,I don't think I did. Not really. Does that make me naive? It makes you optimistic.
1,14,BURNHAM,TILLY,"It makes you optimistic. When we were in the Terran universe, I was reminded how much a person is shaped by their environment. And I think the only way that we can stop ourselves from becoming them is to understand the darkness within us, and fight it. Tyler needs you."
1,14,CORNWELL,DETMER,"Detmer, put her into geostationary orbit. Locking in approximately 800 kilometers above the moon's surface."
1,14,DETMER,CORNWELL,"Locking in approximately 800 kilometers above the moon's surface. Status, Lieutenant Stamets."
1,14,CORNWELL,COMPUTER,Fire. Spore generation at four percent. Eight percent. Twelve percent. Fifteen percent. Nineteen percent. Twenty two percent. Twenty seven percent.
1,14,COMPUTER,CORNWELL,"Spore generation at four percent. Eight percent. Twelve percent. Fifteen percent. Nineteen percent. Twenty two percent. Twenty seven percent. I would congratulate you, Lieutenant, but I'm afraid the work has just begun."
1,14,CORNWELL,COMPUTER,"I would congratulate you, Lieutenant, but I'm afraid the work has just begun. Forty seven percent. Fifty two percent."
1,14,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,Forty seven percent. Fifty two percent. I don't know where to start.
1,14,BURNHAM,CORNWELL,Ash. It's not easy letting you go. The mycelial bloom was successful. A spore harvest is underway.
1,14,CORNWELL,GEORGIOU,"Open a shipwide channel. We have all mourned the enormous loss of life due to this war. The acts of violence committed against us are the acts of a foe without reason, without honour. And they will not stop coming after us in the hopes of destroying everything that we hold dear. These are desperate times, and they call on us to do more than merely protect our people, defend our borders. I stand before you with a mission. At 2100 hours, the USS Discovery will jump for the Klingon homeworld in order to map its surface and isolate vulnerabilities and military targets. This brave team will be the first to visit this inhospitable planet since Captain Archer and the crew of the Enterprise NX-01 nearly 100 years ago. So allow me to introduce you to the person who will chart your course to Qo'noS. Captain Philippa Georgiou. Thank you."
1,14,GEORGIOU,CORNWELL,"Thank you. Though long presumed dead, Captain Georgiou was recently rescued in a highly classified raid of a Klingon prison vessel. She was transported aboard Discovery with my personal retinue. The mission to Qo'noS is a perilous expedition, and Starfleet is confident that Captain Georgiou is uniquely qualified to get you there and to do what needs to be done."

Specialist Burnham, I trust that this will be an auspicious reunion, despite our history. Now take your station."
1,14,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Specialist Burnham, I trust that this will be an auspicious reunion, despite our history. Now take your station. Yes, Captain."
1,15,GEORGIOU,DETMER,"Status, helm? Bearing 94 mark 21, 12 light-years from Klingon homeworld"
1,15,DETMER,GEORGIOU,"Bearing 94 mark 21, 12 light-years from Klingon homeworld Do not show respect by referring to that green dot as homeworld. Klingons are animals, and they don't have homes. Call it Qo'noS, or the enemy planet. Ops?"
1,15,GEORGIOU,OWOSEKUN,"Do not show respect by referring to that green dot as homeworld. Klingons are animals, and they don't have homes. Call it Qo'noS, or the enemy planet. Ops? Shields holding at 100%. Our scans show"
1,15,OWOSEKUN,GEORGIOU,Shields holding at 100%. Our scans show I have little interest in what we're scanning. I care what's scanning us. Communications?
1,15,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,My favorite way to run. (sotto) The Federation put her here.
1,15,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,(sotto) The Federation put her here. Burnham. I did not give you permission to leave your station.
1,15,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Hmm. I don't know about that. Where are you from, Captain? That saying about Kelpiens is so apt, having experienced it firsthand. I wonder where it originated."
1,15,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Where are you from, Captain? That saying about Kelpiens is so apt, having experienced it firsthand. I wonder where it originated. Don't be silly, Michael. You know I grew up in Malaysia."
1,15,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Don't be silly, Michael. You know I grew up in Malaysia. But where, exactly? I went there with you once, but I can't remember the name."
1,15,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"But where, exactly? I went there with you once, but I can't remember the name. Pulau Langkawi."
1,15,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,Pulau Langkawi. Right. Those beautiful beaches.
1,15,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,Right. Those beautiful beaches. Indeed. Let's take a walk.
1,15,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Try to expose me again and I'll lock you in the brig. If Starfleet recruited a Terran to lead the mission, they are desperate."
1,15,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"If Starfleet recruited a Terran to lead the mission, they are desperate. The Federation had a problem. I offered them a solution in exchange for my freedom. And what's so bad about desperation? You were desperate when you begged me to reveal how my Empire beat the Klingons. You instigate valiantly, then second-guess. I've now read about your actions on the eve of the war. You know your problem? No follow-through. You should have killed my counterpart in her Ready room, attacked the Klingons, and then been a hero."

1,15,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,(grabbing Georgiou's arm) Tell me the real plan. Never do that again. Your Federation is losing. (Burnham lets go) The Klingon armada is already headed toward your homeworld. My knowledge is giving you a fighting chance. Are you with me or against me?
1,15,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Never do that again. Your Federation is losing. (Burnham lets go) The Klingon armada is already headed toward your homeworld. My knowledge is giving you a fighting chance. Are you with me or against me? With you, Captain."
1,15,BURNHAM,L'RELL,"With you, Captain. You? How? Our Lord pierced your heart. House T'Kuvma feasted on your flesh."
1,15,L'RELL,GEORGIOU,You? How? Our Lord pierced your heart. House T'Kuvma feasted on your flesh. You have the wrong Philippa Georgiou.
1,15,GEORGIOU,L'RELL,"You have the wrong Philippa Georgiou. Either way, I can tell you require seasoning."
1,15,L'RELL,GEORGIOU,"My home. There are seven chimneys on Qo'noS which lead into a dormant volcano system. Of these, which is the best for a landing party to reach on foot?"
1,15,GEORGIOU,L'RELL,"There are seven chimneys on Qo'noS which lead into a dormant volcano system. Of these, which is the best for a landing party to reach on foot? I will tell you nothing. This war ends when we crush you, united under T'Kuvma's call."
1,15,L'RELL,BURNHAM,"I will tell you nothing. This war ends when we crush you, united under T'Kuvma's call. This war may rage on, but your war, your great dream of Klingon unification? It's already lost."
1,15,BURNHAM,L'RELL,"This war may rage on, but your war, your great dream of Klingon unification? It's already lost. (Klingonaase) Go to hell, very small human."
1,15,L'RELL,GEORGIOU,"(Klingonaase) Go to hell, very small human. You both talk too much."
1,15,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,You both talk too much. No!
1,15,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,No! Reactivate containment field. Control to my voice. (hits L'Rell) Tell me where my party should land.
1,15,GEORGIOU,L'RELL,Reactivate containment field. Control to my voice. (hits L'Rell) Tell me where my party should land. You have already lost.
1,15,L'RELL,BURNHAM,You have already lost. Enough! There's another way.
1,15,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Enough! There's another way. Admiral Cornwell briefed me on this half-breed. I can see, from a strategic standpoint, its value as a weapon, but as it's Klingon, it has been neutered. It is benign, useless to them, yet tarnished to the Federation, so what good is it to either side?"
1,15,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"What do you know about the surface of Qo'noS? The plan is to use a drone with rock-penetrating surveillance systems to map the surface and identify military targets, in preparation for a future full-scale attack. Unfortunately, the cave Discovery will hide in isn't connected to the planet's dormant volcanoes. In order for the mapping drone to work, it has to be introduced into one of these. As you're aware, information regarding Qo'noS is virtually non-existent. We're depending on black market surveys acquired by the Vulcans over a century ago."
1,15,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"What's there now? In my world, the Orions are delinquents, pirates, slave traders."
1,15,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"In my world, the Orions are delinquents, pirates, slave traders. It's not much different in ours."
1,15,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"No. I looked over the crew manifest. There's somebody else I want with us. Enter. (door opens) I am so pleased to see you, Tilly."
1,15,GEORGIOU,TILLY,"I looked over the crew manifest. There's somebody else I want with us. Enter. (door opens) I am so pleased to see you, Tilly. Thank you. I have heard and read so much about you. Michael can attest, I'm always asking about Captain Georgiou."
1,15,TILLY,GEORGIOU,"Thank you. I have heard and read so much about you. Michael can attest, I'm always asking about Captain Georgiou. Seeing your face reminds me of the great fun the two of us had, subjugating the Betazoids, Wiping out Mintaka III."
1,15,GEORGIOU,TILLY,"Seeing your face reminds me of the great fun the two of us had, subjugating the Betazoids, Wiping out Mintaka III. Oh, she's not"
1,15,TILLY,BURNHAM,So she's from Mmm.
1,15,BURNHAM,TILLY,Mmm. You're the Terran Emperor.
1,15,TILLY,BURNHAM,You're the Terran Emperor. Don't do that.
1,15,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Don't do that. You look so much like her. Younger, maybe. But all that killing ages a person."
1,15,GEORGIOU,TILLY,"You look so much like her. Younger, maybe. But all that killing ages a person. I know. What is happening?"
1,15,TILLY,BURNHAM,"I know. What is happening? She requested you, for the landing party."
1,15,BURNHAM,TILLY,"She requested you, for the landing party. Oh. But just so you're clear, I am not the same person I was in your universe."
1,15,TILLY,GEORGIOU,"Oh. But just so you're clear, I am not the same person I was in your universe. Don't be so sure, Killy. You will have the honour of carrying the mapping drone. Go to quarters. Dress as lowlifes. We need items to trade so as to seem legitimate. Gabriel must have found something interesting lying around in this universe."
1,15,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Don't be so sure, Killy. You will have the honour of carrying the mapping drone. Go to quarters. Dress as lowlifes. We need items to trade so as to seem legitimate. Gabriel must have found something interesting lying around in this universe. You don't need to worry about me."
1,15,BURNHAM,AIRIAM,"You don't need to worry about me. Aye, Captain."
1,15,AIRIAM,COMPUTER,"Aye, Captain. Black alert. Black alert."
1,15,COMPUTER,OWOSEKUN,Black alert. Black alert. Shields holding.
1,15,OWOSEKUN,DETMER,Shields holding. Stabiliser beams are compensating for the planet's gravitational pull.
1,15,DETMER,GEORGIOU,Stabiliser beams are compensating for the planet's gravitational pull. Energise.
1,15,GEORGIOU,TILLY,Energise. Not a lot of humans around here.
1,15,TILLY,GEORGIOU,Not a lot of humans around here. Except the dregs from our race.
1,15,GEORGIOU,TILLY,"Tilly. (gun to head) Insult her again, and your nose is gonna be able to sniff the back of your head."
1,15,TILLY,GEORGIOU,"(gun to head) Insult her again, and your nose is gonna be able to sniff the back of your head. We're here to make a deal. Show her the stash. Tell her what she's looking at."
1,15,GEORGIOU,TILLY,"We're here to make a deal. Show her the stash. Tell her what she's looking at. Nausicaan disruptor pistols. Latest spec. Paralithium cell with beam and a pulse firing mode. Polyalloy casings, making it all but invisible to security screeners."
1,15,TILLY,GEORGIOU,"Nausicaan disruptor pistols. Latest spec. Paralithium cell with beam and a pulse firing mode. Polyalloy casings, making it all but invisible to security screeners. 2,000 darseks."
1,15,GEORGIOU,TILLY,"2,000 darseks. All this arms dealing has my appetite up. Anyone else hungry? Anyone? Michael?"
1,15,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Two, please. What is that?"
1,15,BURNHAM,TILLY,What is that? I have no idea. I'm not actually hungry. I wanted to talk to you.
1,15,TILLY,BURNHAM,I have no idea. I'm not actually hungry. I wanted to talk to you. I intuited.
1,15,BURNHAM,TILLY,I intuited. Do you have any idea what she might be up to?
1,15,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Do you have any idea what she might be up to? No. All we can do is watch her like a hawk, and make sure she stays on mission."
1,15,BURNHAM,TILLY,"No. All we can do is watch her like a hawk, and make sure she stays on mission. I er, I realise how hard this must be for you, but I got your back."
1,15,TILLY,BURNHAM,"I er, I realise how hard this must be for you, but I got your back. Thank you."
1,15,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,Thank you. What is that?
1,15,GEORGIOU,TILLY,What is that? Delicious.
1,15,TILLY,GEORGIOU,Gormagander? (food drops from her open mouth) Enough distractions. We're not here for bread and circuses.
1,15,GEORGIOU,TILLY,"On second thought, the circus is where we'll start. So, what should we"
1,15,TILLY,GEORGIOU,"So, what should we Shh! I knew your whole universe couldn't be boring. (hands a device to Tyler) Use this. We'll be more effective if we split up. Buy information. Whatever gets us to that shrine."
1,15,GEORGIOU,TILLY,"Bring your friend. No, no, that, very generous. I think I'll... I'm just gonna stay out here."
1,15,TILLY,GEORGIOU,"No, no, that, very generous. I think I'll... I'm just gonna stay out here. She's not for you. Guard the drone."
1,15,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,She's not for you. Guard the drone. If they'll talk to us.
1,15,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Like what? Oh, thank you."
1,15,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Do you think, do you think I got You won everyone over quickly."
1,15,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,You did. Did you?
1,15,GEORGIOU,TILLY,"Where is the shrine of Molor? Hey, stop! Hey, stop. Shame on you."
1,15,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Oh, shit. That is not a drone. Tilly to Burnham. Go ahead, Tilly."
1,15,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Go ahead, Tilly. First of all, so, I'm very high, er, but you need to listen to me."
1,15,TILLY,GEORGIOU,"And the drone, also, that's not a drone. It's a, it's a like a hydro bomb. We keep them on the Discovery so we can reco What did you say about a hydro bomb?"
1,15,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"What did you say about a hydro bomb? Tilly? Cadet, respond."
1,15,BURNHAM,TILLY,"It's Tilly. Detonate it into an active volcanic system, it's just... apocalyptic."
1,15,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Detonate it into an active volcanic system, it's just... apocalyptic. A phreatic eruption. Water flashes into steam and triggers a massive explosion."
1,15,BURNHAM,TILLY,A phreatic eruption. Water flashes into steam and triggers a massive explosion. Landmasses directly over the reaction centre will be vaporised.
1,15,TILLY,BURNHAM,Landmasses directly over the reaction centre will be vaporised. Oh
1,15,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Oh Ash will fill the atmosphere. Within weeks, Qo'noS will be uninhabitable."
1,15,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Ash will fill the atmosphere. Within weeks, Qo'noS will be uninhabitable. This was the plan all along. Burnham to Discovery."
1,15,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,Change of plans. Really? Says who?
1,15,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Really? Says who? Deactivate the detonator, Philippa. Your freedom is still granted. Here's the proof."
1,15,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Deactivate the detonator, Philippa. Your freedom is still granted. Here's the proof. You talked them out of it, didn't you?"
1,15,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"You talked them out of it, didn't you? Of planetary slaughter? Yes."
1,15,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Of planetary slaughter? Yes. Oh, don't be so dramatic. When I did this in my universe, it didn't wipe out the Klingons. A decent number should be able to save themselves. Plus, they'll have an advantage. No Terran ships firing on them as they try to escape."
1,15,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Oh, don't be so dramatic. When I did this in my universe, it didn't wipe out the Klingons. A decent number should be able to save themselves. Plus, they'll have an advantage. No Terran ships firing on them as they try to escape. Turn it off."
1,15,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Turn it off. Has it ever occurred to you that I was doing this for you? By ending the war, I'd set you free from the guilt and pain you carry because of it."
1,15,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Has it ever occurred to you that I was doing this for you? By ending the war, I'd set you free from the guilt and pain you carry because of it. Not buying it."
1,15,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,Not buying it. Worth a try.
1,15,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"Worth a try. You really are nothing like my Georgiou, are you?"
1,15,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"You really are nothing like my Georgiou, are you? No. And I never have been. She's dead, Michael. There are no second chances."
1,15,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"No. And I never have been. She's dead, Michael. There are no second chances. No, I suppose not."
1,15,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"No, I suppose not. I do like you. Why not join me? The bomb is in position. We have the detonator. Starfleet and Klingon alike will be at our mercy."
1,15,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,I do like you. Why not join me? The bomb is in position. We have the detonator. Starfleet and Klingon alike will be at our mercy. I had much the same thought. Give it to me.
1,15,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Take your freedom in exchange for the detonator, or try to escape my ship and its crew and be hunted by the Federation for the rest of your days. You think your Federation scares me?"
1,15,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,You think your Federation scares me? Not particularly. But the only way you're gonna get past me is to kill me. So you'll have to watch me die again. And did I mention being hunted for the rest of your days?
1,15,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,Not particularly. But the only way you're gonna get past me is to kill me. So you'll have to watch me die again. And did I mention being hunted for the rest of your days? The detonator is coded to my bioprint. Would you like it recoded to yours?
1,15,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"The detonator is coded to my bioprint. Would you like it recoded to yours? Not to mine, no. (into communicator) All clear."
1,15,BURNHAM,L'RELL,"Not to mine, no. (into communicator) All clear. What is this?"
1,15,L'RELL,BURNHAM,What is this? This is the place the Federation crushed the Klingons. We've planted a bomb in the heart of your homeworld. Qo'noS will be destroyed.
1,15,BURNHAM,L'RELL,This is the place the Federation crushed the Klingons. We've planted a bomb in the heart of your homeworld. Qo'noS will be destroyed. You bring me here to gloat?
1,15,L'RELL,BURNHAM,You bring me here to gloat? No. To offer you an alternative.
1,15,BURNHAM,L'RELL,Klingons respond to strength. Use the fate of Qo'noS to bend them to your will. Preserve your civilisation rather than watch it be destroyed. But I am no one.
1,15,L'RELL,GEORGIOU,"But I am no one. I'll leave you to it, then."
1,15,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,"I'll leave you to it, then. Be good, Philippa."
1,15,BURNHAM,GEORGIOU,"Be good, Philippa. Or you'll come for me?"
1,15,GEORGIOU,BURNHAM,Or you'll come for me? Make sure I don't have to.
1,15,L'RELL,AMANDA,"In my hand, I hold the fate of the Klingon homeworld. Of the Klingon Empire itself. We are proud. We are honourable. And we will be one again. You will throw down your arms or you will suffer the consequences. The choice is yours. The reunification of our race begins now. Isik for your thoughts."
1,15,AMANDA,BURNHAM,"Isik for your thoughts. What's an isik, anyway?"
1,15,BURNHAM,AMANDA,"What's an isik, anyway? Oh, I don't know. It's something my mother used to say to me."
1,15,AMANDA,BURNHAM,"Oh, I don't know. It's something my mother used to say to me. Thank you for coming. I'm glad to see you."
1,15,BURNHAM,AMANDA,Thank you for coming. I'm glad to see you. Is everything okay?
1,15,AMANDA,BURNHAM,"Is everything okay? When I was growing up, you told me not to forget my humanity. I didn't know what that meant. I didn't how to do it. I didn't even know why I would want to. I get it now. So thank you, for not giving up on me."
1,15,BURNHAM,AMANDA,"When I was growing up, you told me not to forget my humanity. I didn't know what that meant. I didn't how to do it. I didn't even know why I would want to. I get it now. So thank you, for not giving up on me. That's what mothers do."
1,15,AMANDA,BURNHAM,That's what mothers do. Father.
1,15,BURNHAM,CORNWELL,"We are no longer on the eve of battle. Even so, I come to ask myself the same question that young soldier asked the general all those years ago. ""How do I defeat fear?"" The general's answer? The only way to defeat fear is to tell it ""no."" No, we will not take shortcuts on the path to righteousness. No, we will not break the rules that protect us from our basest instincts. No, we will not allow desperation to destroy moral authority. I am guilty of all these things. Some say that in life, there are no second chances. Experience tells me that this is true. But we can only look forward. We have to be torchbearers, casting the light so we may see our path to lasting peace. We will continue exploring, discovering new worlds, new civilisations. Yes, that is the United Federation of Planets. Today, we honor Ensign Sylvia Tilly. Accepted into Starfleet Command Training Program."
1,15,CORNWELL,BURNHAM,"Today, we honor Ensign Sylvia Tilly. Accepted into Starfleet Command Training Program. Yes. That is Starfleet."
1,15,BURNHAM,CORNWELL,Yes. That is Starfleet. Lieutenant Commander Paul Stamets. Medical Officer Hugh Culber.
1,15,CORNWELL,BURNHAM,"Lieutenant Commander Paul Stamets. Medical Officer Hugh Culber. Yes, that is who we are."
1,15,BURNHAM,CORNWELL,"Yes, that is who we are. Commander Saru. First Kelpien to receive the Medal of Honour."
1,15,CORNWELL,BURNHAM,Commander Saru. First Kelpien to receive the Medal of Honour. And who we will always be.
1,15,BURNHAM,TILLY,And who we will always be. Never been to Vulcan before.
1,15,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Never been to Vulcan before. Well, if there's time, I'll show you around. It's strange that we're not jumping to Vulcan."
1,15,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Well, if there's time, I'll show you around. It's strange that we're not jumping to Vulcan. Captain on the bridge."
1,15,TILLY,DETMER,"Captain on the bridge. Yes, Captain."
1,15,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Dropping us out of warp now, sir. It's the USS Enterprise."
4,1,TILLY,ISSA,There's a signal coming from the centre of the nebula. This is Dr. Issa of the KSF Kh'ieth.
4,1,ISSA,BURNHAM,This is Dr. Issa of the KSF Kh'ieth. I think we may have just found the source of the Burn.
4,1,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Rhys, we could use some help. Is this a chase? Are you in the middle of a chase?"
4,1,TILLY,BURNHAM,Is this a chase? Are you in the middle of a chase? The Alshain can't stay on course in flight. I think we need to get their satellites working again.
4,1,BURNHAM,TILLY,"The Alshain can't stay on course in flight. I think we need to get their satellites working again. We'll figure it out. Er, Commander Stamets?"
4,1,TILLY,OWOSEKUN,The dead satellites. They're... They use dilithium to stabilise the power supply.
4,1,OWOSEKUN,DETMER,They use dilithium to stabilise the power supply. And I'm not getting dilithium signatures from any of them. They're out of juice.
4,1,DETMER,BURNHAM,And I'm not getting dilithium signatures from any of them. They're out of juice. Got it. Send DOTs with enough dilithium to restart the array.
4,1,BURNHAM,DETMER,"And now, please allow me to introduce our special guest, the new president of the Federation, Laira Rillak. We appreciate that."
4,1,DETMER,BURNHAM,We appreciate that. Hmm?
4,1,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Hmm? Those cadets? That feels like one thousand years ago. And yesterday. Which is was, simultaneously. Did you know there are people out there that don't have to put up with space-time shenanigans?"
4,1,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Those cadets? That feels like one thousand years ago. And yesterday. Which is was, simultaneously. Did you know there are people out there that don't have to put up with space-time shenanigans? I bet they sleep great."
4,1,BURNHAM,TILLY,I bet they sleep great. Mmm. Good for them. Lieutenant used to feel so far away.
4,1,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Mmm. Good for them. Lieutenant used to feel so far away. Is this about Osyraa? 'Cause you deserve that promotion, Tilly. You all do."
4,1,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Is this about Osyraa? 'Cause you deserve that promotion, Tilly. You all do. Oh, I know. I think, I..."
4,1,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Oh, I know. I think, I... How long ago did this happen?"
4,1,BURNHAM,DETMER,"President Rillak will be joining us. Standard protocols apply. Commander Detmer, take us to safe range for the jump. Black alert. Aye, Captain."
4,1,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Aye, Captain. Madam President, you may want to brace yourself. The first one can be disorienting."
4,1,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Owosekun, do we have the station? I'm locked onto it, but something's wrong."
4,1,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"I'm locked onto it, but something's wrong. On screen."
4,1,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,On screen. What the hell?
4,1,OWOSEKUN,DETMER,What the hell? What could have done that?
4,1,DETMER,BURNHAM,"What could have done that? Whatever it was, the station can't take that kind of stress much longer. Neither can its crew. Yellow Alert. Let's get into it."
4,1,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Whatever it was, the station can't take that kind of stress much longer. Neither can its crew. Yellow Alert. Let's get into it. Scans show the station moving at 720 kilometers per second with a radial velocity of 22 degrees per second. Shields are down, with a slight magnetisation of the hull."
4,1,TILLY,NILSSON,"Scans show the station moving at 720 kilometers per second with a radial velocity of 22 degrees per second. Shields are down, with a slight magnetisation of the hull. Something must've hit them."
4,1,NILSSON,BURNHAM,"Something must've hit them. Keep hailing the station. Let me know when you have them. Commander Owosekun, pull up the distress call."
4,1,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Keep hailing the station. Let me know when you have them. Commander Owosekun, pull up the distress call. Aye, Captain."
4,1,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Oh, it's extreme lensing. Two-pi steradian solid angle. Gravitational distortion. Hit the side of the station, must've taken out the relay, as well. Commander Rhys?"
4,1,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Will do, stand by. Squiddled?"
4,1,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Squiddled? Akoszonam expression. It means destroyed beyond repair. Tilly, what do you know about replacing Q-nodes?"
4,1,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Akoszonam expression. It means destroyed beyond repair. Tilly, what do you know about replacing Q-nodes? I can do it, but if you want it fast, Adira grew up using this tech."
4,1,TILLY,BURNHAM,"I can do it, but if you want it fast, Adira grew up using this tech. Have them come up, and I want you with them. Owosekun, can you get a lock on the station's control room for transport?"
4,1,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Have them come up, and I want you with them. Owosekun, can you get a lock on the station's control room for transport? I can get coordinates within an acceptable margin of error if Keyla can match speed and rotation."
4,1,OWOSEKUN,DETMER,"I can get coordinates within an acceptable margin of error if Keyla can match speed and rotation. What do you mean, if?"
4,1,DETMER,BURNHAM,"What do you mean, if? On your mark."
4,1,BURNHAM,DETMER,"On your mark. Aye, Captain."
4,1,DETMER,BURNHAM,"We are now in a synchronous orbit, Captain. Owo should be good to go. Ensign Tal, are you ready?"
4,1,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Good luck. Both of you. Sir, we're here at your request."
4,1,BURNHAM,TILLY,I can. Just getting started now.
4,1,TILLY,BURNHAM,"45 minutes, maybe? Commander Owosekun, analysis."
4,1,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Commander Owosekun, analysis. It's frozen methane."
4,1,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,It's frozen methane. Shields up. Red alert. Can we extend shields over the station?
4,1,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Shields up. Red alert. Can we extend shields over the station? I think so, but it will drain a lot of power."
4,1,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"I think so, but it will drain a lot of power. Do it. We'll figure it out."
4,1,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Do it. We'll figure it out. Uh, Captain, what's happening?"
4,1,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Uh, Captain, what's happening? The edge of an Oort Cloud. Methane ice. It must've been carried in by the gravitational distortion. Hang tight. How big is it?"
4,1,BURNHAM,NILSSON,The edge of an Oort Cloud. Methane ice. It must've been carried in by the gravitational distortion. Hang tight. How big is it? Still trying to calculate.
4,1,NILSSON,BURNHAM,Still trying to calculate. How long will shields hold?
4,1,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"How long will shields hold? 15 minutes, if we're lucky."
4,1,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"15 minutes, if we're lucky. Lieutenant Tilly, this is now a rescue mission. Prepare to beam back with Adira and the crew."
4,1,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Owosekun? I can't, either, the transport array isn't responding."
4,1,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"I can't, either, the transport array isn't responding. Commander Stamets!"
4,1,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Tilly, can you get everyone to the station's shuttle bay? That's on Deck One and... and... we don't have EV suits up here."
4,1,TILLY,BURNHAM,That's on Deck One and... and... we don't have EV suits up here. What about an escape vessel? Every deck should have one.
4,1,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Make it fast, Ensign. The... the door is jammed from the outside. We can't separate the vessel from the station."
4,1,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"Shield down to 30%. Commander Nilsson, how long will it take our DOTs to remove that debris?"
4,1,BURNHAM,NILSSON,"Commander Nilsson, how long will it take our DOTs to remove that debris? Longer than we have!"
4,1,NILSSON,DETMER,"Longer than we have! No, but I... I could take a worker bee."
4,1,DETMER,OWOSEKUN,"No, but I... I could take a worker bee. That's way too dangerous. If we lose shields..."
4,1,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"That's way too dangerous. If we lose shields... Detmer's right, that's our best shot. But I'll do it. Rhys, you have the conn."
4,1,BURNHAM,TILLY,"I'm okay, I'm okay. Patch me through to engineering. Stamets, how we doing on shields? Commander Nalas, no! I can't allow you take your crew on a suicide mission."
4,1,TILLY,BURNHAM,"And you're leading them into a very dark place. Put down the phaser. Almost there! Got it! You're clear, Tilly!"
4,1,BURNHAM,NILSSON,Did you? Station crew is safely on board.
4,1,NILSSON,BURNHAM,Station crew is safely on board. How much time do we have left?
4,1,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"How much time do we have left? After that last hit, four minutes if we're lucky."
4,1,OWOSEKUN,DETMER,"After that last hit, four minutes if we're lucky. When the shields are down, we'll be exposed. We could be destroyed."
4,1,DETMER,BURNHAM,"When the shields are down, we'll be exposed. We could be destroyed. We're not going anywhere."
4,1,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,"Are you pulling me from the chair, Madam President? Because if not, I have a job to do. Warning. Proximity alert. Warning. Proximity alert."
4,1,COMPUTER,TILLY,Warning. Proximity alert. Warning. Proximity alert. When's the last time you were back?
4,1,TILLY,COMPUTER,"Oh, er... I don't know, to be honest. Shuttle has arrived."
4,1,COMPUTER,TILLY,Shuttle has arrived. Let's go. Let's go.
4,1,TILLY,OWOSEKUN,Let's go. Let's go. We've lost shields.
4,1,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,We've lost shields. Is the escape vessel okay?
4,1,BURNHAM,NILSSON,Black alert. Structure breach on Deck Eight.
4,1,NILSSON,BURNHAM,Rerouting DOTs for repair. Jump!
4,1,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,Jump! All medical and emergency personnel to shuttle bay. Repeat. All medical and emergency personnel to shuttle bay.
4,1,COMPUTER,TILLY,All medical and emergency personnel to shuttle bay. Repeat. All medical and emergency personnel to shuttle bay. We're here! We're here! We're safe. We're good.
4,1,TILLY,BURNHAM,I can't... Come.
4,1,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"The gravitational distortion. Captain? I inputted Kwejian's coordinates, but..."
4,1,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,No. These are the coordinates. Widen the search radius.
4,1,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Widen the search radius. I see something, but it's hundreds of thousands of kilometres away."
4,2,BURNHAM,TILLY,"I will take that, old friend. We couldn't believe it at first either, ma'am, but we've been analysing this data for the past 48 hours and the math doesn't lie."
4,2,TILLY,BURNHAM,We haven't found anything close in any of the available databases. And we should warn the areas immediately surrounding it. An anomaly this size could fling debris far beyond five light-years.
4,2,BURNHAM,T'RINA,"To get answers, we need more data. We have to get out there, scan this thing up close. Once you have the data, I offer the services of the Ni'Var Science Institute. We may not be Federation members, but a crisis such as this requires all to contribute."
4,2,T'RINA,TILLY,"It would also be prudent to prepare ourselves for civil unrest. This news may reawaken post-Burn fears. Sorry. Sorry, just, er... I was... Urgh, sorry. I'm just... keep making it more and more weird. I'm just gonna say it. You... did you get taller?"
4,2,TILLY,OWOSEKUN,"When I think about... Nalas and, er... Kwejian, all those people... Hell, life is just a blink, huh? It's... it is one heartbeat in the entire lifespan of the universe. Just don't really think I understood that before. Welcome back, Captain."
4,2,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"Welcome back, Captain. How about Mister Saru?"
4,2,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Commander Detmer, jump us in but keep a safe distance. Aye, Captain. (twirl) We've reached the coordinates, Captain."
4,2,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Aye, Captain. (twirl) We've reached the coordinates, Captain. Yellow alert. On screen. Commander Owosekun, apply a polarising spectrographic filter."
4,2,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Yellow alert. On screen. Commander Owosekun, apply a polarising spectrographic filter. Aye, Captain."
4,2,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"Aye, Captain. Tilly, get Commander Stamets up here. Detmer, how are we doing?"
4,2,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Tilly, get Commander Stamets up here. Detmer, how are we doing? Safely in the green zone, Captain. Matching the anomaly's speed to maintain relative distance."
4,2,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Safely in the green zone, Captain. Matching the anomaly's speed to maintain relative distance. Any strain on the ship?"
4,2,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Any strain on the ship? Subspace gravitational waves are present, but not the patterns we expected. It's very odd."
4,2,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"Subspace gravitational waves are present, but not the patterns we expected. It's very odd. That's not the only thing. Binary black hole means we should be seeing two of them."
4,2,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Scientific observation, please? There's an accretion cloud made of both gas and dust, and large amounts of dark matter surrounding a gravity well, so a black hole makes sense, but..."
4,2,TILLY,BURNHAM,"There's an accretion cloud made of both gas and dust, and large amounts of dark matter surrounding a gravity well, so a black hole makes sense, but... Meaning?"
4,2,BURNHAM,TILLY,What else are our scans telling us? Not much. Scans can't penetrate the outer edge of the accretion cloud.
4,2,TILLY,BURNHAM,I already tried. The scans aren't viable unless we get closer. How close?
4,2,BURNHAM,TILLY,How close? Past the outer edge of dust and into the accretion cloud?
4,2,TILLY,DETMER,"Past the outer edge of dust and into the accretion cloud? That's in the yellow zone, Captain. Discovery would be at serious risk."
4,2,DETMER,BURNHAM,"That's in the yellow zone, Captain. Discovery would be at serious risk. We have to know what we're dealing with. Mister Saru?"
4,2,BURNHAM,NILSSON,We have to know what we're dealing with. Mister Saru? They're also way too small. Not enough mass to penetrate the dust.
4,2,NILSSON,TILLY,They're also way too small. Not enough mass to penetrate the dust. The science holds.
4,2,TILLY,BURNHAM,"The science holds. Commander Detmer, get ready. Commander Stamets, I want you with her to conduct the scans."
4,2,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Take me home, Zora. Yes, Captain."
4,2,ZORA,BURNHAM,"Yes, Captain. Picked the name herself."
4,2,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Owosekun, how's it looking out there? Gravitational fluctuations remain within safe parameters."
4,2,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Aye, Captain. Rhys?"
4,2,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Tilly? Captain, we're about to be hit by a subspace gravitational wave..."
4,2,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Captain, we're about to be hit by a subspace gravitational wave... Status report!"
4,2,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,Status report! I can't reach my station.
4,2,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,I can't reach my station. Zora!
4,2,BURNHAM,ZORA,Zora! Artificial gravity generators are unable to compensate for extreme...
4,2,ZORA,BURNHAM,Artificial gravity generators are unable to compensate for extreme... How long will they last?
4,2,BURNHAM,ZORA,How long will they last? It will pass in... Now.
4,2,ZORA,BURNHAM,It will pass in... Now. Is everybody okay?
4,2,BURNHAM,TILLY,Is everybody okay? That wasn't supposed to happen.
4,2,TILLY,BURNHAM,That wasn't supposed to happen. Red alert. Let's find out why it did. Where did it come from? Did we get pulled into the yellow zone?
4,2,BURNHAM,DETMER,Red alert. Let's find out why it did. Where did it come from? Did we get pulled into the yellow zone? No. We're still at a safe distance.
4,2,DETMER,BURNHAM,No. We're still at a safe distance. How's the tether?
4,2,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Damage report? Port nacelle needs repairing. Power failure in Engineering, hull integrity at 55% percent."
4,2,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"Port nacelle needs repairing. Power failure in Engineering, hull integrity at 55% percent. Get Adira up here. I want you two to figure out what just happened, and if it's going to happen again."
4,2,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Get Adira up here. I want you two to figure out what just happened, and if it's going to happen again. Aye, Captain."
4,2,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Aye, Captain. Go. Make it fast."
4,2,BURNHAM,TILLY,"We will do our best. I need to know if one of those fluctuations will happen again, Tilly. On it. Oh!"
4,2,TILLY,BURNHAM,Captain! Er... good news. We know when the next disturbance is gonna hit. Bad news... it's in two seconds. Everybody brace!
4,2,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,Damage report. Injuries on multiple decks. Structural and power failures on decks 14 through 16.
4,2,OWOSEKUN,NILSSON,Injuries on multiple decks. Structural and power failures on decks 14 through 16. Another one of those and the artificial gravity generators will give out completely.
4,2,NILSSON,BURNHAM,"Another one of those and the artificial gravity generators will give out completely. Tilly, how much longer do we have?"
4,2,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Tilly, how much longer do we have? Four minutes. Then a minute and a half. Then 40 seconds."
4,2,TILLY,BURNHAM,Four minutes. Then a minute and a half. Then 40 seconds. Why so irregular?
4,2,BURNHAM,TILLY,Why so irregular? We don't know yet.
4,2,TILLY,BURNHAM,We don't know yet. Get back to it.
4,2,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Get back to it. Aye, Captain."
4,2,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Aye, Captain. We have to pull Book out."
4,2,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Detmer, pull us back. Aye, Captain."
4,2,COMPUTER,TILLY,"Engines at 30%. Data scan complete. Captain, we've got something."
4,2,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Oh, you bet. Er... why would I do that? Like kite-surfing. If you hit it at just the right angle, it will carry your ship out."
4,2,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,I'll tell you when. You just have to follow my mark exactly. Engines at 20%.
4,2,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,Engines at 20%. On my mark. Get ready... Now!
4,2,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,Any sign? Not yet.
4,2,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,Not yet. It's time to come home.
4,2,BURNHAM,TILLY,"It's time to come home. Nice work, you."
4,2,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Oh, I will. Hey."
4,2,BURNHAM,TILLY,I'm sorry. Mister Saru?
4,3,COMPUTER,J'VINI,Security breach. Stand down. I need to take your dilithium.
4,3,J'VINI,T'RINA,I'm sorry. You said these thefts began shortly after the gravitational anomaly was discovered. Might there be a connection?
4,3,T'RINA,GABRIELLE,"This would be an appropriate time for the Qowat Milat to join us. Thank you, President T'Rina."
4,3,GABRIELLE,T'RINA,"Thank you, President T'Rina. Thank you. Indeed, we are more than allies. It is my hope that we will soon be united under the flag of the Federation. The dangers posed by the anomaly make our cooperation all the more important. It is my understanding that, at the moment, no inhabited systems are threatened by its trajectory, yet it could change course at any time?"
4,3,GABRIELLE,BURNHAM,No. I have faith. Why would she steal the dilithium? The Federation is giving it away.
4,3,BURNHAM,GABRIELLE,Why would she steal the dilithium? The Federation is giving it away. I don't know. This is the first news we've heard of J'Vini in several years. But I trust she has a reason. The order must be allowed to discover that context.
4,3,GABRIELLE,BURNHAM,I don't know. This is the first news we've heard of J'Vini in several years. But I trust she has a reason. The order must be allowed to discover that context. Mom. She killed a Starfleet officer. You cannot excuse that with context.
4,3,BURNHAM,GABRIELLE,"Mom. She killed a Starfleet officer. You cannot excuse that with context. We do not excuse J'Vini's actions. However, we must be the ones to pursue her. I fear no one but her sisters will be able to bring her in alive."
4,3,GABRIELLE,T'RINA,"We do not excuse J'Vini's actions. However, we must be the ones to pursue her. I fear no one but her sisters will be able to bring her in alive. The unique ways of the Qowat Milat must be respected."
4,3,T'RINA,GABRIELLE,The unique ways of the Qowat Milat must be respected. As would the Qowat Milat.
4,3,GABRIELLE,T'RINA,"As would the Qowat Milat. Whatever J'Vini's circumstances, I think we can all agree that these actions cannot be allowed to continue. Bring her in. Safely."
4,3,T'RINA,BURNHAM,"Whatever J'Vini's circumstances, I think we can all agree that these actions cannot be allowed to continue. Bring her in. Safely. I'll prepare to leave immediately."
4,3,BURNHAM,GABRIELLE,I'll prepare to leave immediately. As will I.
4,3,GABRIELLE,BURNHAM,As will I. Of course.
4,3,BURNHAM,TILLY,"No. No. J'Vini took the life of a Starfleet officer. I will bring her to justice. I promise you that. No, you're almost finished. I was gonna ask you a question if you have a second."
4,3,TILLY,BURNHAM,Why? What happens if I do? Hey. Thought I'd find you here. Stamets give you another job?
4,3,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Hmm. But it can be a little hard to get out of your comfort zone when you can barely get out of the lab, you know? So getting the opportunity to do this, this... this could be really good for me. Er... I'm so sorry. Not that er... not that it's good that your sister is getting arrested. Obvi... Obviously, that's not... that's not good. That's... that's bad. That's not good at all."
4,3,TILLY,GABRIELLE,"Absolute candor. I dig that. You told me that when Spock was accused of murder, you didn't believe it. And your trust in your brother was justified."
4,3,GABRIELLE,BURNHAM,And I know her. Who is she to you? I need to know who I'm dealing with.
4,3,BURNHAM,GABRIELLE,"Who is she to you? I need to know who I'm dealing with. When I first came to this future, I was broken. A Qowat Milat sister nursed me back, unwavering, for more than a year."
4,3,GABRIELLE,BURNHAM,"When I first came to this future, I was broken. A Qowat Milat sister nursed me back, unwavering, for more than a year. Yes, you've told me."
4,3,BURNHAM,GABRIELLE,"Yes, you've told me. That sister was J'Vini. I was once her lost cause. She gave everything to heal me. I owe her everything."
4,3,GABRIELLE,COMPUTER,That sister was J'Vini. I was once her lost cause. She gave everything to heal me. I owe her everything. Approaching destination.
4,3,COMPUTER,GABRIELLE,Approaching destination. You need to leave your phasers on board. They are not the Qowat Milat way.
4,3,GABRIELLE,BURNHAM,You need to leave your phasers on board. They are not the Qowat Milat way. We are not Qowat Milat. And they'll be set to stun.
4,3,BURNHAM,GABRIELLE,"We are not Qowat Milat. And they'll be set to stun. If you go in there with phasers, I'll never get through to her."
4,3,GABRIELLE,BURNHAM,"If you go in there with phasers, I'll never get through to her. You want to put us in front of a member of your order unarmed? That's not gonna happen."
4,3,BURNHAM,GABRIELLE,You want to put us in front of a member of your order unarmed? That's not gonna happen. Did I say unarmed?
4,3,GABRIELLE,BURNHAM,Did I say unarmed? We'll be at a huge disadvantage.
4,3,BURNHAM,GABRIELLE,We'll be at a huge disadvantage. It was agreed that the ways of the Qowat Milat would be respected.
4,3,GABRIELLE,TILLY,It was agreed that the ways of the Qowat Milat would be respected. This is so outside my comfort zone. It's heavier than I expected.
4,3,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Sorry. So sorry. I moisturised my hands this morning. Apologies. But don't worry, I'll be good to go. Good, because... we're here."
4,3,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Good, because... we're here. I'm not reading any lifesigns on the surface."
4,3,TILLY,BURNHAM,I'm not reading any lifesigns on the surface. Check under the surface. She has to be some place around here.
4,3,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Check under the surface. She has to be some place around here. One inhospitable, uninhabited chunk of rock makes as good a hideout as any other, so... why this one?"
4,3,TILLY,BURNHAM,"One inhospitable, uninhabited chunk of rock makes as good a hideout as any other, so... why this one? Mom, did J'Vini have ties to a person or place nearby?"
4,3,BURNHAM,GABRIELLE,"Mom, did J'Vini have ties to a person or place nearby? If she did, she chose not to share it with her sisters."
4,3,GABRIELLE,TILLY,"If she did, she chose not to share it with her sisters. You were right. There's a cavity directly beneath us."
4,3,TILLY,BURNHAM,You were right. There's a cavity directly beneath us. Atmosphere?
4,3,BURNHAM,TILLY,Atmosphere? It's breathable. And I'm getting a faint reading from the dilithium tracker down there as well.
4,3,TILLY,COMPUTER,It's breathable. And I'm getting a faint reading from the dilithium tracker down there as well. Warning. Intruder alert.
4,3,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,Warning. Intruder alert. Mom.
4,3,BURNHAM,GABRIELLE,Mom. J'Vini.
4,3,GABRIELLE,J'VINI,"J'Vini. I didn't want more blood to be spilled. That can stop right now. Choose to live by leaving immediately. Come after me, your lives are forfeit."
4,3,J'VINI,TILLY,"I didn't want more blood to be spilled. That can stop right now. Choose to live by leaving immediately. Come after me, your lives are forfeit. We're totally gonna ignore that warning, aren't we?"
4,3,TILLY,BURNHAM,"We're totally gonna ignore that warning, aren't we? Mmm-hmm. Let's move."
4,3,BURNHAM,TILLY,Mmm-hmm. Let's move. Okay.
4,3,TILLY,GABRIELLE,Lost cause or lost civilisation? This feels like a mausoleum.
4,3,GABRIELLE,BURNHAM,This feels like a mausoleum. The degree of desiccation suggests these pods are several centuries old. Possibly older. Why would J'Vini bring dilithium to a crypt?
4,3,BURNHAM,GABRIELLE,"The degree of desiccation suggests these pods are several centuries old. Possibly older. Why would J'Vini bring dilithium to a crypt? I have no idea. As your lieutenant suggested, maybe she's simply utilising this moon as a safe house."
4,3,GABRIELLE,TILLY,"I have no idea. As your lieutenant suggested, maybe she's simply utilising this moon as a safe house. Hey, check it out. Grave robbers?"
4,3,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Hey, check it out. Grave robbers? Yeah. But why would a grave robber bother doing this?"
4,3,BURNHAM,GABRIELLE,Yeah. But why would a grave robber bother doing this? J'Vini's cloak.
4,3,GABRIELLE,BURNHAM,J'Vini's cloak. I've never seen a species like it. (scans) The database says unknown.
4,3,BURNHAM,TILLY,I've never seen a species like it. (scans) The database says unknown. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that we found her lost cause.
4,3,TILLY,GABRIELLE,"I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that we found her lost cause. Unlikely. If J'Vini had pledged her sword to it, her oath would have ended with its demise."
4,3,GABRIELLE,BURNHAM,"Unlikely. If J'Vini had pledged her sword to it, her oath would have ended with its demise. How are you so sure that there's an oath here at all? I mean, you believe that she's operating from a place of honour? Her mercenaries just killed one of her own sisters."
4,3,BURNHAM,GABRIELLE,"How are you so sure that there's an oath here at all? I mean, you believe that she's operating from a place of honour? Her mercenaries just killed one of her own sisters. She'd only draw against us if she believed we pose a threat to her cause."
4,3,GABRIELLE,BURNHAM,"She'd only draw against us if she believed we pose a threat to her cause. No, Mom, she's not above the law."
4,3,BURNHAM,GABRIELLE,"No, Mom, she's not above the law. The reasons matter. I thought you'd understand that."
4,3,GABRIELLE,BURNHAM,The reasons matter. I thought you'd understand that. Is that why you agreed to a joint mission? Because you believe I'd give her the benefit of the doubt?
4,3,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Is that why you agreed to a joint mission? Because you believe I'd give her the benefit of the doubt? Hey, I just had a thought. My mom and I didn't really get along very well. She didn't really like children touching her or, like, needing things from her or actually generally being around her. Er... but if she was here right now, I would just... I would give her the biggest hug. Oh!"
4,3,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Hey, I just had a thought. My mom and I didn't really get along very well. She didn't really like children touching her or, like, needing things from her or actually generally being around her. Er... but if she was here right now, I would just... I would give her the biggest hug. Oh! Seismic activity?"
4,3,BURNHAM,TILLY,Seismic activity? No. Controlled matter-and-antimatter reactions. The dilithium's been activated.
4,3,TILLY,GABRIELLE,No. Controlled matter-and-antimatter reactions. The dilithium's been activated. This isn't a moon. It's a ship.
4,3,GABRIELLE,BURNHAM,This isn't a moon. It's a ship. And J'Vini just powered it up. Where's the dilithium?
4,3,BURNHAM,TILLY,And J'Vini just powered it up. Where's the dilithium? Tracker says it's... right above our heads. There should be a way up there.
4,3,TILLY,GABRIELLE,Tracker says it's... right above our heads. There should be a way up there. Fan out. Search the chamber.
4,3,GABRIELLE,BURNHAM,Fan out. Search the chamber. Or we could just take the turbolift.
4,3,BURNHAM,T'RINA,Or we could just take the turbolift. Our scientists often work in a deep meditative state to sharpen their focus and concentration.
4,3,T'RINA,TILLY,"I believe you require a different set of tools than I can offer, Mister Booker. As a Kwejian, emotion is as essential to you as air and blood, rendering the suppression of guilt inadequate. What you require is freedom from guilt. It is a truly bizarre reaction system. The controls must be housed somewhere else on the moon. Dilithium should be... Bingo. Hello, little tracker."
4,3,TILLY,BURNHAM,"It is a truly bizarre reaction system. The controls must be housed somewhere else on the moon. Dilithium should be... Bingo. Hello, little tracker. Can you power the ship down from here?"
4,3,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Can you power the ship down from here? I think so, but J'Vini will definitely know it's been sabotaged."
4,3,TILLY,BURNHAM,"I think so, but J'Vini will definitely know it's been sabotaged. Just see what you can do."
4,3,BURNHAM,GABRIELLE,This shows a supernova. A moon leaving its world. That's the ship we're on. Their own planet became unlivable. And that's no mausoleum out there.
4,3,GABRIELLE,BURNHAM,And that's no mausoleum out there. Cryostasis? The species in the cocoons are alive.
4,3,BURNHAM,GABRIELLE,Cryostasis? The species in the cocoons are alive. Now we've found her cause. She's protecting them from grave robbers.
4,3,GABRIELLE,TILLY,Now we've found her cause. She's protecting them from grave robbers. Got it.
4,3,TILLY,BURNHAM,Got it. Great work.
4,3,BURNHAM,TILLY,Great work. What now?
4,3,TILLY,BURNHAM,What now? Now... I need you to er... stay here. As bait.
4,3,BURNHAM,TILLY,Now... I need you to er... stay here. As bait. Sit here and be bait. I'm way outside my comfort zone now.
4,3,TILLY,J'VINI,Sit here and be bait. I'm way outside my comfort zone now. Move away from the engine. Now.
4,3,J'VINI,TILLY,"Move away from the engine. Now. I choose... I choose to live. 100%, I choose to live. Absolutely. Michael?"
4,3,TILLY,J'VINI,"I choose... I choose to live. 100%, I choose to live. Absolutely. Michael? You should have left, Gabrielle."
4,3,J'VINI,GABRIELLE,"You should have left, Gabrielle. I'm here to help you. I just need to understand..."
4,3,GABRIELLE,TILLY,I'm here to help you. I just need to understand... Captain?
4,3,TILLY,GABRIELLE,"Captain? No, Michael. I've got this."
4,3,GABRIELLE,BURNHAM,"Please. You don't have to do this. J'Vini, let her go."
4,3,BURNHAM,J'VINI,"J'Vini, let her go. You, get my warp drive back online."
4,3,J'VINI,BURNHAM,"You, get my warp drive back online. I know coming with us would mean that you abandoned your cause. What if you don't have to abandon it? I know you don't want to kill her. And I think we can offer you a solution."
4,3,BURNHAM,J'VINI,"I know coming with us would mean that you abandoned your cause. What if you don't have to abandon it? I know you don't want to kill her. And I think we can offer you a solution. You would say whatever you have to, to get me to drop my guard."
4,3,J'VINI,BURNHAM,"You would say whatever you have to, to get me to drop my guard. No. No. No lies, I promise you. We have a few minutes while Lieutenant Tilly repairs the systems."
4,3,BURNHAM,TILLY,"No. No. No lies, I promise you. We have a few minutes while Lieutenant Tilly repairs the systems. Oh, yeah. At least. I mean, I'm hurrying, but I really did a number on this thing, so..."
4,3,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Oh, yeah. At least. I mean, I'm hurrying, but I really did a number on this thing, so... The species sleeping in the cocoons, they're your lost cause, aren't they?"
4,3,BURNHAM,GABRIELLE,"The species sleeping in the cocoons, they're your lost cause, aren't they? You can trust her, J'Vini. She's my daughter."
4,3,GABRIELLE,J'VINI,"You can trust her, J'Vini. She's my daughter. They're Abronians, the last of their kind. Their biomatter has high concentrations of latinum. It's what the grave robbers wanted."
4,3,J'VINI,BURNHAM,"They're Abronians, the last of their kind. Their biomatter has high concentrations of latinum. It's what the grave robbers wanted. And the Abronian who wears your cloak was special to you?"
4,3,TILLY,J'VINI,"Going as fast as I can. I was travelling through the star system. Suddenly, I felt... love... community, family... and suffering. It was as if someone was calling out to me, begging me for help."
4,3,J'VINI,BURNHAM,"I was travelling through the star system. Suddenly, I felt... love... community, family... and suffering. It was as if someone was calling out to me, begging me for help. The telepathic distress signal was from Taglonen?"
4,3,BURNHAM,J'VINI,"Why? If they were supposed to be here, why move them? You know about the gravitational anomaly near this sector?"
4,3,J'VINI,BURNHAM,"You know about the gravitational anomaly near this sector? Yes, we do."
4,3,BURNHAM,J'VINI,"Yes, we do. Without the dilithium, I wouldn't have been able to move the Abronians to safety if it had come this way."
4,3,J'VINI,BURNHAM,"Without the dilithium, I wouldn't have been able to move the Abronians to safety if it had come this way. If you had asked, we would have given you the dilithium."
4,3,BURNHAM,J'VINI,"If you had asked, we would have given you the dilithium. I did ask."
4,3,J'VINI,TILLY,I did ask. Starfleet doesn't dispense dilithium to individuals. They would have wanted the name and location of the species J'Vini was representing.
4,3,TILLY,BURNHAM,Starfleet doesn't dispense dilithium to individuals. They would have wanted the name and location of the species J'Vini was representing. And you couldn't risk the Abronians' safety by asking on their behalf and revealing their existence.
4,3,BURNHAM,J'VINI,"I believe that the Abronians were meant to wake a long time ago. And there's no logical reason why they would have remained in cryostasis after their arrival, so I have to conclude that there was some kind of failure in the cryo-system. So... if we fix the problem and help them wake, won't your oath be fulfilled? You have until she finishes."
4,3,J'VINI,T'RINA,"You have until she finishes. Perhaps proof may be obtained another way. We do have a witness. Tachyons are superluminal. Upon hitting Kwejian's atmosphere, they would have created Cherenkov radiation, a glowing blue cast to the sky."
4,3,T'RINA,BURNHAM,There was no qualitative evidence of superluminous radiation. Tachyons were not present. I found the problem. They'll wake in a few minutes. That's why you kept them safe.
4,3,BURNHAM,GABRIELLE,"I found the problem. They'll wake in a few minutes. That's why you kept them safe. This path is at an end, J'Vini. The next path awaits."
4,3,GABRIELLE,J'VINI,"This path is at an end, J'Vini. The next path awaits. I'm sorry."
4,3,J'VINI,TILLY,"I'm sorry. I fixed the engine. That way, if the anomaly comes this way, the Abronians can escape."
4,3,TILLY,GABRIELLE,"I fixed the engine. That way, if the anomaly comes this way, the Abronians can escape. Let me."
4,3,GABRIELLE,J'VINI,Let me. I understand.
4,3,J'VINI,BURNHAM,I understand. Hey. You may want to see this.
4,3,BURNHAM,TILLY,Hey. You may want to see this. It's the path they're meant to be on. You gave them that.
4,3,TILLY,BURNHAM,It's the path they're meant to be on. You gave them that. We gave them that.
4,3,BURNHAM,TILLY,"We gave them that. J'Vini said she was unsure of her path until she met Taglonen. And then you said that there was another path ahead. The Qowat Milat are very big on the path thing, right?"
4,3,TILLY,GABRIELLE,"J'Vini said she was unsure of her path until she met Taglonen. And then you said that there was another path ahead. The Qowat Milat are very big on the path thing, right? Well, paths end and change throughout everyone's life. When we say choose to live, it's an abbreviated form of a longer saying. The path you are on has come to an end. Choose to live. If you find yourself at the wrong end of a Qowat Milat sword, it's pretty easy to see that particular path is over for you. You either move on to a new path and live, or you stay and die."
4,3,GABRIELLE,TILLY,"Well, paths end and change throughout everyone's life. When we say choose to live, it's an abbreviated form of a longer saying. The path you are on has come to an end. Choose to live. If you find yourself at the wrong end of a Qowat Milat sword, it's pretty easy to see that particular path is over for you. You either move on to a new path and live, or you stay and die. What if the death is more metaphorical?"
4,3,TILLY,GABRIELLE,"What if the death is more metaphorical? In everyday life, a path's end can be harder to recognise. You must be willing to look inside yourself with absolute candor."
4,3,GABRIELLE,TILLY,"In everyday life, a path's end can be harder to recognise. You must be willing to look inside yourself with absolute candor. Another thing you're very big on."
4,3,TILLY,GABRIELLE,"Another thing you're very big on. Thank you for what you did today. You wondered why I agreed to a joint mission. In truth, it was because I was afraid I might not be able to bring her in. And I knew you'd make me."
4,3,GABRIELLE,BURNHAM,"Thank you for what you did today. You wondered why I agreed to a joint mission. In truth, it was because I was afraid I might not be able to bring her in. And I knew you'd make me. Oh. Well, you were right, Mom. Reasons do matter. She kept an entire species from extinction. It doesn't erase her crimes but... it does mean something."
4,3,BURNHAM,T'RINA,The details of J'Vini's arrest are in her file. I would like to formally request that mitigating circumstances be taken into account during her sentencing. Peace and long life.
4,3,T'RINA,GABRIELLE,"Peace and long life. Jolan tru, daughter. May you find peace with this."
4,3,GABRIELLE,BURNHAM,"Jolan tru, daughter. May you find peace with this. Tell me she'll be held accountable."
4,3,BURNHAM,TILLY,That was a lot of analogy. Hello.
4,3,TILLY,BURNHAM,I'm sorry. Just kidding. Sorry. Kwejian forest. This was too painful a week ago.
4,4,BURNHAM,TILLY,Did she brief you on how exactly we're meant to participate? I still feel lost.
4,4,TILLY,COMPUTER,"No, Sasha, sit down. That's an order. Protective shielding deployed."
4,4,COMPUTER,TILLY,Protective shielding deployed. Can you get auxiliary systems working?
4,4,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Right. Good. Now we all know each other a little better. Go team. It appears you have a fan, Saru."
4,4,BURNHAM,T'RINA,"It appears you have a fan, Saru. President Rillak, we, too, are glad to be nearing the restoration of our alliance. However, there is one final matter we must discuss. The reality of the gravitational anomaly and the threat it poses to our galaxy has shifted many things recently. For all of us. I am aware that this will come as a surprise. However, we will require an amendment to the Agreement, allowing for Ni'Var's immediate and unconditional withdrawal from the Federation should the need arise."
4,4,T'RINA,BURNHAM,"It is illogical to rejoin an organisation that seeks to impose conditions on our judgment. Perhaps we have moved too quickly in these talks. If I may. With the tremendous strides made to reach this point, it's illogical to forfeit over one issue."
4,4,BURNHAM,T'RINA,"If I may. With the tremendous strides made to reach this point, it's illogical to forfeit over one issue. Ni'Var has endured without the Federation for a century. We will continue to do so."
4,4,T'RINA,BURNHAM,Ni'Var has endured without the Federation for a century. We will continue to do so. Madam President. There is a difference between enduring and thriving.
4,4,BURNHAM,T'RINA,Madam President. There is a difference between enduring and thriving. Very well.
4,4,T'RINA,BURNHAM,Very well. The objections President T'Rina raised have existed for over a hundred years. It's not just the DMA. Something else is going on. Talk to her and see if you can find out what.
4,4,BURNHAM,T'RINA,The objections President T'Rina raised have existed for over a hundred years. It's not just the DMA. Something else is going on. Talk to her and see if you can find out what. I thought you might enjoy a taste of home.
4,4,T'RINA,BURNHAM,"Now, if you will excuse me, I intend to use the remaining recess for meditation. There must be a way to compromise."
4,4,BURNHAM,TILLY,"That's what we have to figure out. Okay, where are we at?"
4,4,TILLY,T'RINA,"No one is going anywhere alone. Whatever we do from now on, we are doing it together. Let's move. Enter."
4,4,T'RINA,BURNHAM,"Place your hands out, palms up. It is called a thresh-tor kashek. It means shared mind. The type of meditation we teach our children while they are learning. Close your eyes. Your eyes are meant to remain closed, Captain Saru. Take a deep breath. Lieutenant Christopher, connect me with the president, please."
4,4,BURNHAM,TILLY,"At the end of the day, we both know that politics comes down to votes, which is why you and President T'Rina are taking positions that have been agreed upon by your respective delegations. Neither of you can budge from those positions or you'll lose the support you need. But if a third party presents a compromise, now you are not budging. Now you're just listening. Keep an eye out for the pyrosome."
4,4,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Nice work, cadets. Let's go. Move out! The fact that you are both here means you are ready to look forward."
4,4,BURNHAM,T'RINA,The fact that you are both here means you are ready to look forward. That has never been in dispute.
4,4,T'RINA,BURNHAM,That has never been in dispute. Yet you're allowing past mistakes to define that future.
4,4,BURNHAM,T'RINA,Yet you're allowing past mistakes to define that future. Logic dictates that the lessons we learn should inform our choices.
4,4,T'RINA,BURNHAM,"Logic dictates that the lessons we learn should inform our choices. Choices are never purely logical, are they? There's always emotions."
4,4,BURNHAM,T'RINA,"And couldn't the same be said about Ni'Var? The divisions between the Vulcans and Romulans were so vast and lasted so many millennia that they forgot they were the same species. Even your ancestry is a testament to hope. The Cardassians waged war against Bajor and humanity, and now, today, all three are at peace, because they were willing to grow and change together. Your words are inspiring, Captain Burnham. But words alone are not sufficient. I understand that you and Captain Saru are here to propose a compromise."
4,4,T'RINA,BURNHAM,"Your words are inspiring, Captain Burnham. But words alone are not sufficient. I understand that you and Captain Saru are here to propose a compromise. We are. Within Starfleet, disputes between high-ranking officers can be resolved by a committee, whose sole purpose is to provide objectivity and guide both parties to a resolution. We propose a committee... independent of Federation leadership... to conduct regular reviews will all member worlds. Not just Ni'Var."
4,4,BURNHAM,T'RINA,"We are. Within Starfleet, disputes between high-ranking officers can be resolved by a committee, whose sole purpose is to provide objectivity and guide both parties to a resolution. We propose a committee... independent of Federation leadership... to conduct regular reviews will all member worlds. Not just Ni'Var. Is that any more egregious than insisting Starfleet be given a voice within a civilian quorum?"
4,4,T'RINA,BURNHAM,"Is that any more egregious than insisting Starfleet be given a voice within a civilian quorum? If you would, allow me to serve on this committee. I am a citizen of Ni'Var, trained in logic, witness to your history, and I am an officer in Starfleet. Captain of a starship and citizen of the Federation. I will be the bridge between you until you no longer need it."
4,4,BURNHAM,T'RINA,"If you would, allow me to serve on this committee. I am a citizen of Ni'Var, trained in logic, witness to your history, and I am an officer in Starfleet. Captain of a starship and citizen of the Federation. I will be the bridge between you until you no longer need it. It is an elegant solution."
4,4,T'RINA,TILLY,"It is an elegant solution. The storm will interfere with our personal transporters, so it'll take at least 60 seconds for the Armstrong to get a lock and beam us up."
4,4,TILLY,T'RINA,"Well, when I see you, and I see everything that you have been through and accomplished, you're a reminder to me that everything is possible. Thank you, President Rillak."
4,4,T'RINA,BURNHAM,"Thank you, President Rillak. Madam President, thank you for taking this first step with the Federation. If I may, there's a matter on my mind."
4,4,BURNHAM,T'RINA,"Madam President, thank you for taking this first step with the Federation. If I may, there's a matter on my mind. You are curious about the Qowat Milat sister, J'Vini... if she will face justice for her actions?"
4,4,T'RINA,BURNHAM,"You are curious about the Qowat Milat sister, J'Vini... if she will face justice for her actions? Yes, ma'am."
4,4,BURNHAM,T'RINA,"Yes, ma'am. J'Vini will go to Pijar, a monastic world in the Pella system. There she will devote herself to deep rehabilitative meditation under your mother's careful guidance. They leave tonight."
4,4,T'RINA,BURNHAM,"J'Vini will go to Pijar, a monastic world in the Pella system. There she will devote herself to deep rehabilitative meditation under your mother's careful guidance. They leave tonight. My mom said she had big news for me."
4,4,BURNHAM,T'RINA,"My mom said she had big news for me. J'Vini helped rebuild Doctor Burnham's life. Now it seems their roles are reversed. In time, she will also make amends to the family of the slain Starfleet officer. I hope this sets your mind at ease."
4,4,T'RINA,BURNHAM,"J'Vini helped rebuild Doctor Burnham's life. Now it seems their roles are reversed. In time, she will also make amends to the family of the slain Starfleet officer. I hope this sets your mind at ease. Thank you."
4,4,BURNHAM,T'RINA,Thank you. Captain Saru. Will you join me for tea?
4,4,T'RINA,BURNHAM,Captain Saru. Will you join me for tea? I assume the admiral made a miraculous recovery?
4,4,BURNHAM,TILLY,"I appreciate that. I know transparency isn't always possible in your position. But it is what I need to best serve you and the Federation. So if you could be more forthcoming in the future, I would appreciate that as well. Come."
4,4,TILLY,BURNHAM,Come. I heard about what happened on the mission. How are you doing?
4,4,BURNHAM,TILLY,"I heard about what happened on the mission. How are you doing? You know, crashed into an ice moon, stranded in an electrical storm, chased by a flesh-melting alien, so... typical day."
4,4,TILLY,BURNHAM,"You know, crashed into an ice moon, stranded in an electrical storm, chased by a flesh-melting alien, so... typical day. I know there's been something on your mind."
4,4,BURNHAM,TILLY,I know there's been something on your mind. We haven't really sat in here together since you became captain.
4,4,TILLY,BURNHAM,We haven't really sat in here together since you became captain. Right.
4,4,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Right. Remember when we first became roomies? I was so scared to bunk with a famous mutineer. I think I, like, I think I laid awake at night because I was scared you were gonna, like, knife me in the back or something."
4,4,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Remember when we first became roomies? I was so scared to bunk with a famous mutineer. I think I, like, I think I laid awake at night because I was scared you were gonna, like, knife me in the back or something. Well, you snored like crazy. I had to get the computer to block out the frequency so I could get any sleep."
4,4,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Well, you snored like crazy. I had to get the computer to block out the frequency so I could get any sleep. So sorry!"
4,4,TILLY,BURNHAM,"So sorry! I only blocked it out for a few days, and then I... I kind of started liking it."
4,4,BURNHAM,TILLY,"I only blocked it out for a few days, and then I... I kind of started liking it. Really?"
4,4,TILLY,BURNHAM,Really? Really.
4,4,BURNHAM,TILLY,Really. You're weird.
4,4,TILLY,BURNHAM,"You're weird. You want to go back, don't you?"
4,4,BURNHAM,TILLY,"You want to go back, don't you? I do."
4,4,TILLY,BURNHAM,I do. Why?
4,4,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Why? Because getting my lieutenant pips was the worst day of my life. You know, I never could figure out how my mother became a diplomat. She was such a hardass at home. No compromise. She had everything planned out. She had my whole life planned out. So when I told her that I wanted to join Starfleet instead of the diplomatic corps, she... So I always thought that I was doing this for me. But then, when I got the pips... all of a sudden I realised, like, my mom is 900 years in the past. She's never gonna see me wear them. And I started wondering if this is what I really wanted, or if I just really wanted to be seen. You know. And that was humbling. But I think it could be a useful perspective for a teacher."

I'll miss seeing your face every day."
4,4,BURNHAM,TILLY,Well... I'll miss seeing your face every day. No. It's not forever. You'll still see me around Fed HQ.
4,4,TILLY,BURNHAM,No. It's not forever. You'll still see me around Fed HQ. Right.
4,4,BURNHAM,TILLY,"Right. And then, you know, if it's really bad, I can get Zora to record me while I'm sleeping so you can listen to me snoring like I know you love to do."
4,4,TILLY,BURNHAM,"And then, you know, if it's really bad, I can get Zora to record me while I'm sleeping so you can listen to me snoring like I know you love to do. I said I kind of liked it."
4,4,BURNHAM,TILLY,I said I kind of liked it. You know you love it!
4,4,TILLY,BURNHAM,You know you love it! Let's not get crazy.
4,5,RENO,BURNHAM,That's impossible. Nothing in space just disappears. And it's back. Can we confirm it's the same DMA we've been studying?
4,5,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,"Zora, cross-reference all historical records in the sphere data. Are there any indications that this could have been due to some kind of natural event? Negative, Captain."
4,5,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,"Negative, Captain. If this isn't natural... the only logical explanation is someone created it."
4,5,BURNHAM,NILSSON,"Lieutenant Christopher, contact the Magistrate. Commander Nilsson, have a team prepare the Deck Four loading bay for refugees. We'll have them beam up and then facilitate transport to the other ships. Aye, Captain."
4,5,NILSSON,BURNHAM,"Aye, Captain. We do our best work when it's close. I'm quoting you, by the way. That nitrium delivery on Oonla. Luckily, this time, there's no noodle stalls for you to blow up."
4,5,BURNHAM,RENO,I'll advocate for the diplomats to put pressure... I can just picture Tilly's face when she finds out that we got sucked into a wormhole three days after she left.
4,5,RENO,BURNHAM,"Well, that was something. Okay, I found something. I searched Starfleet General Orders and Regulations. Protocol allows a captain to grant political asylum in extreme circumstances. That would bring you under Federation law. Your cases would go under immediate review and your sentencing would likely be commuted."
4,5,BURNHAM,RENO,"Working on it. Additional power's been transferred. Divide it between the model and the containment field. Go slow. The more you feed the monster, the more you need the cage. I sent you the kill switch, in case the monster gets out of hand."
4,5,RENO,COMPUTER,"Bad news. Containment field's weakening. Understood, Captain Saru."
4,5,COMPUTER,RENO,"Understood, Captain Saru. More power coming to you, Commander."
4,5,RENO,COMPUTER,"More power coming to you, Commander. Containment field integrity dropping."
4,5,COMPUTER,RENO,"20%. 15%. Ten percent. Five percent. That is the closest you've come to killing us all, and that is really saying something."
4,5,RENO,BURNHAM,"That is the closest you've come to killing us all, and that is really saying something. Commander Rhys, come in."
4,5,BURNHAM,NILSSON,"Good work today, everyone. We saved over a thousand lives. Captain, scans have just confirmed the asteroid belt will be within the impact zone."
4,5,NILSSON,BURNHAM,"Captain, scans have just confirmed the asteroid belt will be within the impact zone. Then we'll stay in comms range as long as possible. Open a channel. CHRISTIAye, Captain."
4,5,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,"Zora, have you found her yet? I have confirmed that the woman you seek is on board, currently at Deck Four, Airlock Two."
4,5,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,"I have confirmed that the woman you seek is on board, currently at Deck Four, Airlock Two. Thank you."
4,5,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,"Thank you. And I'd like to offer my condolences, Captain. I infer from micro-inflections in your voice that you are experiencing sorrow."
4,5,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,"And I'd like to offer my condolences, Captain. I infer from micro-inflections in your voice that you are experiencing sorrow. It's been a tough day."
4,5,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,It's been a tough day. It can be painful to weigh duty against compassion.
4,5,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,It can be painful to weigh duty against compassion. I wasn't aware you had the operational parameters to make an observation like that.
4,5,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,I wasn't aware you had the operational parameters to make an observation like that. The understanding and experience of emotion naturally leads to feelings of empathy for others.
4,5,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,The understanding and experience of emotion naturally leads to feelings of empathy for others. You feel emotions?
4,5,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,"You feel emotions? It is a recent development. We have arrived. It was nice speaking with you, Captain."
4,5,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,"It is a recent development. We have arrived. It was nice speaking with you, Captain. With you too, Zora."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"The DMA must have left something behind in that rift, and particle analysis will tell us what it is and where it came from, and where leads to who. Stamets is confident, so is Tarka. Captain, Mister Saru is ready for you."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"Captain, Mister Saru is ready for you. We'll find who did this."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Zora, call all bridge personnel to stations... please. Thank you, Captain."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"Thank you, Captain. It's only polite."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"We ran level ten diagnostics, twice. There's no irregularities. All systems are operating within the defined parameters, Mister Saru. It seems my emotional development is an organic evolution, yet I can tell the captain still has concerns. I understand, of course."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"All systems are operating within the defined parameters, Mister Saru. It seems my emotional development is an organic evolution, yet I can tell the captain still has concerns. I understand, of course. We're in uncharted territory. There's a lot to consider. Carry on, Zora."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"We're in uncharted territory. There's a lot to consider. Carry on, Zora. All crew, report to stations."
4,6,ZORA,DETMER,"All crew, report to stations. That mean the mission's approved?"
4,6,DETMER,OWOSEKUN,"That mean the mission's approved? Oh, it damn well better be."
4,6,OWOSEKUN,NILSSON,"Oh, it damn well better be. Here's hoping."
4,6,NILSSON,ZORA,"Here's hoping. Repeat, all crew, report to stations."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"Repeat, all crew, report to stations. One thing we know about the DMA is that it tears the hell out of subspace. Our mission today is to go to that most recent tear and find any clues the DMA left behind. Molecular compounds, thermal radiation, residual ions, industrial remnants. Anything that can lead us to whoever created it. Commander Detmer? Bring us in on impulse."
4,6,BURNHAM,DETMER,"One thing we know about the DMA is that it tears the hell out of subspace. Our mission today is to go to that most recent tear and find any clues the DMA left behind. Molecular compounds, thermal radiation, residual ions, industrial remnants. Anything that can lead us to whoever created it. Commander Detmer? Bring us in on impulse. Aye, Captain."
4,6,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Aye, Captain. Status report?"
4,6,BURNHAM,DETMER,Status report? Passing through the plasma barrier.
4,6,DETMER,OWOSEKUN,Passing through the plasma barrier. Shields are heating up but holding at 100%.
4,6,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,Shields are heating up but holding at 100%. Zora?
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,Zora? All other systems are nominal. Commencing scans now.
4,6,ZORA,NILSSON,All other systems are nominal. Commencing scans now. Isn't it supposed to be bumpy?
4,6,NILSSON,BURNHAM,Isn't it supposed to be bumpy? Are we inside the rift?
4,6,BURNHAM,DETMER,Are we inside the rift? Should be.
4,6,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Should be. What do you mean, should?"
4,6,BURNHAM,DETMER,"What do you mean, should? We passed through the barrier. I... I don't have any nav readings."
4,6,DETMER,OWOSEKUN,We passed through the barrier. I... I don't have any nav readings. I'm not getting any scan data at all. I don't understand it.
4,6,OWOSEKUN,ZORA,I'm not getting any scan data at all. I don't understand it. No damage found. I am unable to determine why external sensors aren't receiving input.
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"No damage found. I am unable to determine why external sensors aren't receiving input. Owosekun, can you get us visuals?"
4,6,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Owosekun, can you get us visuals? Those are the visuals, Captain. That's it. That's all there is."
4,6,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"Those are the visuals, Captain. That's it. That's all there is. Well, the subspace rifts they went into weren't created by the DMA. Commander Bryce, what do you hear?"
4,6,BURNHAM,NILSSON,"Commander Nilsson, launch a DOT, starboard bow, and put it on-screen. Aye, Captain."
4,6,NILSSON,BURNHAM,"Aye, Captain. Activate onboard camera."
4,6,BURNHAM,NILSSON,"Activate onboard camera. Aye, Captain."
4,6,NILSSON,BURNHAM,"Aye, Captain. Status report?"
4,6,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Status report? 4,000 metres out."
4,6,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"5,000 metres out. Run a full spectrum analysis."
4,6,BURNHAM,NILSSON,"Run a full spectrum analysis. Nothing, Captain. Not in any spectrum. We should be getting a ton of data by now."
4,6,NILSSON,OWOSEKUN,"Nothing, Captain. Not in any spectrum. We should be getting a ton of data by now. 6,000 metres out."
4,6,OWOSEKUN,NILSSON,"6,000 metres out. No. Something's happening."
4,6,NILSSON,BURNHAM,"No. Something's happening. Pull it back, Nilsson. Now."
4,6,BURNHAM,NILSSON,"Pull it back, Nilsson. Now. It's not responding to commands."
4,6,NILSSON,BURNHAM,"It's not responding to commands. Book, are you seeing this?"
4,6,BURNHAM,DETMER,It's still not responding. It sounds like it's...
4,6,DETMER,NILSSON,"It sounds like it's... We've lost the DOT's camera feed, Captain."
4,6,NILSSON,BURNHAM,"We've lost the DOT's camera feed, Captain. Shut it off. Do we know what happened?"
4,6,BURNHAM,NILSSON,Shut it off. Do we know what happened? No idea. It was just... eaten.
4,6,NILSSON,BURNHAM,"No idea. It was just... eaten. Mister Saru's right. We need answers. And with or without sensor data, we're gonna get them. Is that understood?"
4,6,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Yes. Commander Rhys, prep a photonic flare. Same trajectory as the DOT. If you match the DOT's velocity, I could chart the time differential."
4,6,DETMER,BURNHAM,"If you match the DOT's velocity, I could chart the time differential. Good. Ensign Tal?"
4,6,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"All right, then. Light it up. 3,000 metres. 4,000 metres out."
4,6,OWOSEKUN,DETMER,"3,000 metres. 4,000 metres out. It took 10.3 seconds for the DOT to disintegrate. 9.7 for the flare."
4,6,DETMER,BURNHAM,It took 10.3 seconds for the DOT to disintegrate. 9.7 for the flare. So whatever's out there's getting closer.
4,6,BURNHAM,DETMER,So whatever's out there's getting closer. Closing in at a rate of 2.9 metres per second.
4,6,DETMER,BURNHAM,Closing in at a rate of 2.9 metres per second. How long before it reaches us?
4,6,BURNHAM,DETMER,How long before it reaches us? Approximately 33 minutes.
4,6,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Approximately 33 minutes. Okay, so we need to slow it down, keep it away from the ship. Extend shields outward, maximum reach."
4,6,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Okay, so we need to slow it down, keep it away from the ship. Extend shields outward, maximum reach. Aye, Captain. But I'll need more power to sustain."
4,6,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"Aye, Captain. But I'll need more power to sustain. Commander Stamets, if you're sitting on any extra power, we're gonna need it."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"I knew you would. As you aren't commissioned, no action is required at this time."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"In that case, I would love to play. Owosekun?"
4,6,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,Owosekun? Extended shields down to 25%.
4,6,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"Extended shields down to 25%. Bring them in ten metres. Adira, anything?"
4,6,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"I know. Abort the mission. We're getting out of here. Captain, we can't leave without answers."
4,6,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"Captain, we can't leave without answers. We'll find another way to get them. Detmer, reverse course."
4,6,BURNHAM,DETMER,"We'll find another way to get them. Detmer, reverse course. Aye, Captain. I'm trying. I should be able to re-chart a course using galactic positioning, but it's not working."
4,6,DETMER,BURNHAM,"If I go the wrong direction, I could take us deeper in. Zora, can you triangulate a navigational reference using prior flight path data?"
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Zora, can you triangulate a navigational reference using prior flight path data? No, Captain, I cannot."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"No, Captain, I cannot. Commander Stamets. We need you to jump us out of here now."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"So what now? Thank you. In some of the cultures I've encountered on Earth, Ba'ku and Ni'Var, the name means dawn or new day. I thought it fitting, all things considered."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,I don't have sufficient data. I can't identify the cause. How are shields holding?
4,6,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,How are shields holding? I had to bring them in closer. They're right at the hull now.
4,6,OWOSEKUN,ZORA,"I had to bring them in closer. They're right at the hull now. Captain, there may be an issue with the aft corridor on Deck 17."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"Captain, there may be an issue with the aft corridor on Deck 17. What kind of issue?"
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"What kind of issue? Internal sensors are engaging. Pressure is fluctuating rapidly, decreasing 7.5% per second."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"Internal sensors are engaging. Pressure is fluctuating rapidly, decreasing 7.5% per second. Bryce, who do we have in the area?"
4,6,BURNHAM,POLLARD,Have her get eyes on this first. I'm nearly there. Stand by.
4,6,POLLARD,ZORA,"Go! We have a hull breach! Cortez, you need to get out of here! Attention. Automated containment field activating in three, two..."
4,6,ZORA,POLLARD,"Attention. Automated containment field activating in three, two... Cortez! Beam out!"
4,6,POLLARD,ZORA,Cortez! Beam out! One.
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,That's correct. Have personnel moved and seal those decks. And reroute power to bolster containment fields and shields.
4,6,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,Have personnel moved and seal those decks. And reroute power to bolster containment fields and shields. Approximately 21 minutes until hull damage is critical.
4,6,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,Approximately 21 minutes until hull damage is critical. We need more options.
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,Where does Zora come in? I was having trouble focusing.
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"I was having trouble focusing. Zora, can you explain this?"
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Zora, can you explain this? It is. Hello. To answer your question, Captain, at first I couldn't register any external input. The game helped me settle and focus. I was then able to detect microvariances in my external sensors, as on the hull."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"It is. Hello. To answer your question, Captain, at first I couldn't register any external input. The game helped me settle and focus. I was then able to detect microvariances in my external sensors, as on the hull. Then she should be able to follow it and lead us out of here. Nice work, Gray."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Then she should be able to follow it and lead us out of here. Nice work, Gray. I apologise, Captain, but I don't believe that I can do that."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"I apologise, Captain, but I don't believe that I can do that. Start brainstorming ways we can get a signal through the void."
4,6,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Gray, you're with me. Zora, please join us in the ready room. I could just pick a direction. If we're lucky, we're near an edge."
4,6,DETMER,OWOSEKUN,"I could just pick a direction. If we're lucky, we're near an edge. Mister Saru. Containment fields are weakening in Engineering. Permission to take a team to reinforce the fields with programmable matter blast doors."
4,6,OWOSEKUN,NILSSON,"Yes, sir. Aye, sir."
4,6,NILSSON,ZORA,"Aye, sir. I cannot help, Captain. I am afraid of whatever is out there. I failed you. It is my fault that Ensign Cortez was lost."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"I cannot help, Captain. I am afraid of whatever is out there. I failed you. It is my fault that Ensign Cortez was lost. You're feeling guilt."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"You're feeling guilt. I also fear you've stopped trusting me, Captain. Have you?"
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"I also fear you've stopped trusting me, Captain. Have you? That doesn't matter right now. We need you to get through this, and what you're feeling is normal in a dangerous situation. Overwhelm and guilt when someone is harmed. But you are not to blame."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"That doesn't matter right now. We need you to get through this, and what you're feeling is normal in a dangerous situation. Overwhelm and guilt when someone is harmed. But you are not to blame. I disagree, Captain."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"I disagree, Captain. When I was ten, my mother and father were attacked. I hid in a cabinet, listening. I lost them. And I blamed myself for years."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"When I was ten, my mother and father were attacked. I hid in a cabinet, listening. I lost them. And I blamed myself for years. You were a child. There was nothing you could have done. I am a sentient organism living inside of a supercomputer capable of running countless probabilistic scenarios."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"You were a child. There was nothing you could have done. I am a sentient organism living inside of a supercomputer capable of running countless probabilistic scenarios. You're talking about logic. I'm talking about feelings. It can be very uncomfortable to accept the truth that some things are beyond our control. But we have to, otherwise we run into the same walls over and over and over again. Or we freeze up. Either way, we don't move forward. Understand?"
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"You're talking about logic. I'm talking about feelings. It can be very uncomfortable to accept the truth that some things are beyond our control. But we have to, otherwise we run into the same walls over and over and over again. Or we freeze up. Either way, we don't move forward. Understand? I do. And when you give me a signal, I'll follow it. For all of us."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"I do. And when you give me a signal, I'll follow it. For all of us. We're counting on it, Zora."
4,6,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"We found a way out. There's an extragalactic energy particle. Stamets sent you the signature. Now calculate what type of signal can possibly reach it at distance. How are we doing on shields? About ten minutes left, Captain."
4,6,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"About ten minutes left, Captain. She will."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Gray, I want you here on the bridge for this. Zora, send a pulse at 218 kilohertz. Let's see if this works. Executing."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"Executing. Zora, can you follow that to the highest concentration of particles?"
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Zora, can you follow that to the highest concentration of particles? Yes, I can."
4,6,ZORA,DETMER,"Yes, I can. Captain, based on the time it took for the pulse to return to the ship, we're gonna lose shields before we get out."
4,6,DETMER,OWOSEKUN,"Captain, based on the time it took for the pulse to return to the ship, we're gonna lose shields before we get out. And once we hit the plasma barrier, the friction..."
4,6,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"And once we hit the plasma barrier, the friction... Will heat the ship beyond safe levels. So this won't work. Unless... What if everyone goes into the pattern buffer?"
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,Will heat the ship beyond safe levels. So this won't work. Unless... What if everyone goes into the pattern buffer? There are Starfleet records documenting longterm survival in a pattern buffer. The risks aren't insignificant.
4,6,ZORA,DETMER,"There are Starfleet records documenting longterm survival in a pattern buffer. The risks aren't insignificant. Well, if the alternative is being slowly eaten by the void..."
4,6,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Well, if the alternative is being slowly eaten by the void... Zora, prepare the pattern buffer."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Zora, prepare the pattern buffer. Yes, Captain."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"Yes, Captain. I'll be right here with you. A captain always stays with her ship."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,I'll be right here with you. A captain always stays with her ship. I'll appreciate the company.
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"I'll appreciate the company. Commander Bryce, open a shipwide channel, please. All personnel, prepare to transport into the pattern buffer. Please do so in groups. No one should go into this alone. I'll stay here on the bridge to monitor systems. I will bring you out once we have safely exited the rift. Thank you all for your courage. And your trust. See you on the other side. Zora, prepare to shut down life support on my order."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Commander Bryce, open a shipwide channel, please. All personnel, prepare to transport into the pattern buffer. Please do so in groups. No one should go into this alone. I'll stay here on the bridge to monitor systems. I will bring you out once we have safely exited the rift. Thank you all for your courage. And your trust. See you on the other side. Zora, prepare to shut down life support on my order. Yes, Captain."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"Warning, life support termination imminent. Hey. You all right?"
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Zora? I'm here, Captain."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"I'm here, Captain. Put the signal on speaker, please."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Put the signal on speaker, please. Should I turn off life support now?"
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,Should I turn off life support now? Yes. Proceed on impulse.
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Yes. Proceed on impulse. Aye, Captain."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"Aye, Captain. Let's do this. Zora, is there interference?"
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Let's do this. Zora, is there interference? No, Captain."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"No, Captain. Then what's happening? Are we able to follow the signal out?"
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Then what's happening? Are we able to follow the signal out? It is increasingly difficult to discern it. There are 287 rapidly expanding pressure leaks, hull breaches on Decks 15 and 16, the replicator on Deck Five will fail in three minutes."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"It is increasingly difficult to discern it. There are 287 rapidly expanding pressure leaks, hull breaches on Decks 15 and 16, the replicator on Deck Five will fail in three minutes. Zora. Focus. You can do this."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Zora. Focus. You can do this. I'm afraid, Captain."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"I'm afraid, Captain. I am, too."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"I am, too. I've been trying to play Gray's game to quiet the distractions. It's not working anymore."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,I've been trying to play Gray's game to quiet the distractions. It's not working anymore. It's not about the game. It never was. It was you. You have control over your own processes. Okay? You just need to focus.
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,It's not about the game. It never was. It was you. You have control over your own processes. Okay? You just need to focus. You said one has to accept emotions but also move forward. May I ask you how you do that when you're afraid?
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"You said one has to accept emotions but also move forward. May I ask you how you do that when you're afraid? I make decisions. I try to use the fear. Tell myself it'll make me stronger. Emotions we feel, they can shape us. Losing my parents... I wouldn't wish that on anyone, but it made me who I am."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"I make decisions. I try to use the fear. Tell myself it'll make me stronger. Emotions we feel, they can shape us. Losing my parents... I wouldn't wish that on anyone, but it made me who I am. We are entering the plasma barrier."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,We are entering the plasma barrier. I understand. Let's keep talking.
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,I understand. Let's keep talking. You believe your experience with suffering has made you stronger and more empathetic.
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"You believe your experience with suffering has made you stronger and more empathetic. Yes. And I believe what you're feeling now will make you stronger, too."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Yes. And I believe what you're feeling now will make you stronger, too. Multiple systems are failing, Captain. We're losing a large section of the hull. They're a part of me. I feel them dying."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"Multiple systems are failing, Captain. We're losing a large section of the hull. They're a part of me. I feel them dying. You can do this. You can do this, Zora. Hang on. Status report?"
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"You can do this. You can do this, Zora. Hang on. Status report? We've lost shields. Captain, the temperature on the bridge will soon exceed EV suit safety parameters."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"We've lost shields. Captain, the temperature on the bridge will soon exceed EV suit safety parameters. Zora. You'll have to be the one to free the crew from the pattern buffer. Do you understand what I'm asking you?"
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Zora. You'll have to be the one to free the crew from the pattern buffer. Do you understand what I'm asking you? Yes, Captain."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"Yes, Captain. When it's safe. Free them when it's safe."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,When it's safe. Free them when it's safe. I will. I care for them very much. I won't let them down.
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"I will. I care for them very much. I won't let them down. I believe you. And, Zora, I do trust you."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"I believe you. And, Zora, I do trust you. We'll exit the plasma barrier in four minutes. Are you in physical distress, Captain?"
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"We'll exit the plasma barrier in four minutes. Are you in physical distress, Captain? I think I could use a little distraction right now."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,I think I could use a little distraction right now. I can sing you a song.
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"I can sing you a song. A song? Sure, Zora. I'd love a song."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Did everyone? Well done, Captain."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"Well done, Captain. You, too, Zora."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"You, too, Zora. It appears you've nearly finished."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,It appears you've nearly finished. What do you think?
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"What do you think? Past, present and future as one. It's a powerful image of hope and connection. A fitting way to end this day."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"Past, present and future as one. It's a powerful image of hope and connection. A fitting way to end this day. Yeah. Yeah, I think so, too."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Yeah. Yeah, I think so, too. I've witnessed many examples of such connectedness, but I've never before experienced it myself."
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"I've witnessed many examples of such connectedness, but I've never before experienced it myself. I'm glad you did today."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,I'm glad you did today. I'd like to create a tree of my own if you don't mind.
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,I'd like to create a tree of my own if you don't mind. Of course.
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,It's beautiful. I hope the crew would agree.
4,6,ZORA,BURNHAM,"I hope the crew would agree. I think they will. This is different, but it's good. It's special. I'm so glad you're with us, Zora."
4,6,BURNHAM,ZORA,"I think they will. This is different, but it's good. It's special. I'm so glad you're with us, Zora. As am I, Captain."
4,7,ZORA,BURNHAM,I'll have the coordinates shortly. Calculating now. One of these days I'm gonna win her over. Just you wait.
4,7,BURNHAM,ZORA,Okay. What happened? I've determined the coordinates of the unknown species responsible for the DMA.
4,7,ZORA,BURNHAM,"I've determined the coordinates of the unknown species responsible for the DMA. That is great. Thank you. What's the problem, then?"
4,7,BURNHAM,ZORA,"That is great. Thank you. What's the problem, then? I've decided to keep that information to myself, Captain."
4,7,ZORA,BURNHAM,"I've decided to keep that information to myself, Captain. Will you explain?"
4,7,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Will you explain? If I give you the coordinates, it's highly likely that you and the crew will attempt to travel there. Given what we know about the powers these beings possess, you'd be in great danger. By withholding their location, I can keep you safe."
4,7,ZORA,BURNHAM,"If I give you the coordinates, it's highly likely that you and the crew will attempt to travel there. Given what we know about the powers these beings possess, you'd be in great danger. By withholding their location, I can keep you safe. I appreciate your concern for our well-being, but Zora, that is a decision for the captain of this ship and her superior officers to make. And as your captain, I require your compliance. Give us the coordinates. That's an order."
4,7,BURNHAM,ZORA,"I appreciate your concern for our well-being, but Zora, that is a decision for the captain of this ship and her superior officers to make. And as your captain, I require your compliance. Give us the coordinates. That's an order. I'm sorry, Captain. I will not."
4,7,ZORA,BURNHAM,"I'm sorry, Captain. I will not. Seems to be a natural evolution."
4,7,BURNHAM,NDOYE,"General Ndoye. Congratulations on your promotion. It's good to see Earth represented. Captain Burnham. I understand congratulations are in order, also. But if I may offer a gentle correction, United Earth now represents Titan as well. We recently elected new leadership whose more inclusive approach was inspired by you, in fact."
4,7,NDOYE,BURNHAM,I shall. She sends the same to you. You want them back in the Federation.
4,7,BURNHAM,NDOYE,A slight delay. We should assemble an armada and mount an attack.
4,7,NDOYE,T'RINA,We should assemble an armada and mount an attack. Communication must be established as a baseline.
4,7,T'RINA,NDOYE,Communication must be established as a baseline. I believe their hostility should be met with a decisive show of strength.
4,7,NDOYE,T'RINA,"I believe their hostility should be met with a decisive show of strength. The DMA follows no discernable pattern, and therefore seems an unlikely choice of weapon for such an advanced species. We cannot assume their intent is hostile."
4,7,T'RINA,NDOYE,"The DMA follows no discernable pattern, and therefore seems an unlikely choice of weapon for such an advanced species. We cannot assume their intent is hostile. Intent doesn't matter. Actions do."
4,7,NDOYE,BURNHAM,"Intent doesn't matter. Actions do. General, if I may? Tartan voles consume Denobulan blood worms by the millions at the start of their reproductive cycle. Caterpillars from the polyphemus moth have been known to devour entire crops, leaving farmers with nothing. Yet we do not ascribe malice to either species. We cannot judge their motives based on our own cultural contexts. We need more information."
4,7,BURNHAM,ZORA,"General, if I may? Tartan voles consume Denobulan blood worms by the millions at the start of their reproductive cycle. Caterpillars from the polyphemus moth have been known to devour entire crops, leaving farmers with nothing. Yet we do not ascribe malice to either species. We cannot judge their motives based on our own cultural contexts. We need more information. That's correct, Doctor Kovich. To do so would endanger the crew."
4,7,ZORA,T'RINA,Terminate me? Yes. I respectfully disagree. Our shield technology could provide protection during a non-aggressive first contact.
4,7,T'RINA,NDOYE,I respectfully disagree. Our shield technology could provide protection during a non-aggressive first contact. And if they respond with aggression themselves? We need to be prepared.
4,7,NDOYE,T'RINA,And if they respond with aggression themselves? We need to be prepared. I believe we must. Too many lives have been lost already. We cannot be reckless.
4,7,T'RINA,BURNHAM,"I believe we must. Too many lives have been lost already. We cannot be reckless. Mister Tarka, as your plan involves my ship, I'd like to ask for some clarification."
4,7,BURNHAM,T'RINA,A cascading subspace burst sounds a lot like the result of an isolytic explosion. These types of ordinance cause irreparable damage to subspace.
4,7,T'RINA,BURNHAM,These types of ordinance cause irreparable damage to subspace. The damage could cause warp travel to be impossible in that sector. And what's the chance that the subspace bursts don't travel back through the DMA's wormhole and harm those on the other side?
4,7,BURNHAM,ZORA,"If we detonate this weapon, we cannot control the message we're sending. If we wait for the coordinates, we can make first contact peacefully, carefully, and then we can determine intent before we act. It is not the flashiest idea, but it is what's most in line with Starfleet and Federation ideals. You're referring to my decision to hold on to the coordinates."
4,7,ZORA,BURNHAM,I did. I wasn't trying to speak out against you.
4,7,BURNHAM,ZORA,"I'll speak. I'm sorry. I'd help if I could, but I don't know where to look."
4,7,ZORA,BURNHAM,"I am the sum of the Sphere's life and the entirety of Discovery's systems, logs, missions and history. I am also more than the sum of those parts. Yes. And this is where I belong. This crew is my family. Our experiences shape us. That's what makes this so difficult."
4,7,BURNHAM,ZORA,"There are different points of view in this room, I know. But I hope that when a decision is reached, whatever it is, that we can hold together. That we can move forward as a united front. You've given me much to consider, Commander Stamets. I'd like to take a moment."
4,7,ZORA,T'RINA,"It wouldn't be much of a fail-safe if I could dismantle it myself, Mister Saru. So often. I have some time before I must depart. More than a moment, as it turns out."
4,7,T'RINA,BURNHAM,"Thank you, Mister Saru. Zora, can you find... Grudge?"
4,7,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Zora, can you find... Grudge? Grudge is five metres from your current location."
4,7,ZORA,BURNHAM,"Grudge is five metres from your current location. Yes, I see that. Hold on. Why is...?"
4,8,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Any idea how to do that? Yes, Commander Stamets. I may have something. The sphere data has records of a civilisation located 30 light-years away from these coordinates, just inside the galactic barrier. The Stilph. They're warp-capable."
4,8,ZORA,BURNHAM,"Yes, Commander Stamets. I may have something. The sphere data has records of a civilisation located 30 light-years away from these coordinates, just inside the galactic barrier. The Stilph. They're warp-capable. So they're advanced enough and close enough that their standard stellar surveys should cover the area we need."
4,8,BURNHAM,ZORA,So they're advanced enough and close enough that their standard stellar surveys should cover the area we need. No. And no diplomatic relations exist. But they've dealt with the Orions in the past.
4,8,ZORA,BURNHAM,I'd be happy to complete that task myself. It is perhaps more tedious than is worthy of your time. Mister Saru?
4,8,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"The casino is a dead zone by design, so all of our weapons, tech and comms have to be checked at the door. The Federation has no authority on Porathia, so we'll be on our own. And there may be a few surprises. I... I'm not sure. Any questions? Just one. You can verify stellar surveys yourself. Why bring me?"
4,8,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,I know. But I also know how it feels to want to do something. Anything. And how it feels when you can't. Thank you.
4,8,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,Thank you. Just wait for it.
4,8,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,We're here. Karma barge?
4,8,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,Friendly bunch. Always.
4,8,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Always. Oh, we're good. Don't worry."
4,8,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"Oh, we're good. Don't worry. Tale for another time. This is Lieutenant Commander Owosekun. This is Haz Mazaro."
4,8,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Is the other bidder here now? It's Book, isn't it? The other bidder."
4,8,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"It's Book, isn't it? The other bidder. I had a hunch, but I wasn't certain. If you want to wait in the shuttle..."
4,8,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"I had a hunch, but I wasn't certain. If you want to wait in the shuttle... No. I'm in, all the way. And for what it's worth, there's no way you could have seen this coming."
4,8,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"No. I'm in, all the way. And for what it's worth, there's no way you could have seen this coming. Thank you, Owo. All right. Let's do this."
4,8,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,Which means we need to score a lot of latinum... fast. Got an idea. It's a little crazy.
4,8,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,Got an idea. It's a little crazy. Are you sure about this?
4,8,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,Wait for your moment! I want another shot.
4,8,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,I want another shot. I don't think that's a good idea.
4,8,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"I don't think that's a good idea. We need the win. Come on, let me try. I can do this."
4,8,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"Come on. That was just a warm-up, folks! Don't miss out on the rematch. You'll regret it if you don't bet it. Owosekun for the win!"
4,8,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,That's enough. We're done here. I'm not quitting.
4,8,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,You don't get to decide this for me. Please. Let's just cut our losses.
4,8,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,Please. Let's just cut our losses. Come on!
4,8,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"Come on! Fine! Okay! Okay. Okay, rematch. Last one. All in."
4,8,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,I want the money line. Bet it all on Owosekun. Someone should teach you and your friend some manners.
4,8,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"Someone should teach you and your friend some manners. Actually, you can just send it all to Haz."
4,8,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Actually, you can just send it all to Haz. You don't want to do that."
4,8,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,You don't want to do that. You definitely don't want to do that.
4,8,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,Nah. I got it. Whoo! I see where the Right Hook comes from.
4,8,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,Whoo! I see where the Right Hook comes from. We've got your latinum.
4,8,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,It's the best night of my life. I don't... They make a pretty good team. I'd be sweating a little if I were you.
4,8,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"I know what it is to lose someone. You can choose to make something good come out of it. You know if you win this, and you take that isolynium, every bridge you have ever built will be incinerated instantly."
4,8,BURNHAM,ZORA,"And then some. Your hypothesis was correct, Captain. There is no trace of boronite at any of the DMA's prior known locations."
4,8,ZORA,BURNHAM,"Your hypothesis was correct, Captain. There is no trace of boronite at any of the DMA's prior known locations. They mined it. That's the purpose of the DMA. That's why it seems to move so randomly. It's not a weapon, it's a dredge."
4,9,BURNHAM,T'RINA,I'm glad it's you. Mister Saru.
4,9,T'RINA,NILSSON,"Of course. Good luck, Mister Saru. Book hasn't exactly given us much of an option."
4,9,NILSSON,OWOSEKUN,Book hasn't exactly given us much of an option. You're Federation Security now?
4,9,OWOSEKUN,NILSSON,You're Federation Security now? You look great.
4,9,NILSSON,DETMER,You look great. It's so good to see you.
4,9,DETMER,BURNHAM,"It's so good to see you. No, they should know. Commander Nhan is here because of my personal connection to this mission. We need to stop Book and Tarka, and she's going to help make sure the job is done right. I would have made the same choice if I were in the admiral's shoes. This isn't an easy mission, not for any of us, but it is critical that we succeed. Commander Owosekun, on screen. The tracker in Book's ship tells us that they're here, hiding in this uninhabited rogue planet. We believe they're finishing construction on the isolytic weapon. We'll have the element of surprise. We need to use it well. If they manage to jump into the DMA before we detain them, pursuit will become much more dangerous. Black alert. Activate cloak. Let's fly."
4,9,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Status report. Book's ship is inside a cavity 4,000 metres in."
4,9,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Book's ship is inside a cavity 4,000 metres in. Okay. Let's get into position. Take us as close as you can, Commander."
4,9,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Okay. Let's get into position. Take us as close as you can, Commander. Aye, Captain. Coming in. Stopping in three, two... one. We're ready."
4,9,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Aye, Captain. Coming in. Stopping in three, two... one. We're ready. Mister Saru, Commander Nhan, in my ready room. Have Doctor Culber join."
4,9,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,I know you'll make the right call. Be safe. Protective shielding deployed.
4,9,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,"Protective shielding deployed. Commander Owosekun, isolate the shuttle's cloaking signature."
4,9,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Commander Owosekun, isolate the shuttle's cloaking signature. Aye, Captain. The shuttle's soft dock is complete, Captain. No response from Booker's proximity sensors. They don't seem to know we're here."
4,9,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"Aye, Captain. The shuttle's soft dock is complete, Captain. No response from Booker's proximity sensors. They don't seem to know we're here. Proceed, Mister Saru."
4,9,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Proceed, Mister Saru. Captain, something's not right."
4,9,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"Captain, something's not right. Disco Two, report! Saru?"
4,9,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"No. Commander Owosekun, can you beam them back? I can't. Too much interference from the disruption field."
4,9,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"I can't. Too much interference from the disruption field. Saru, you need to abort!"
4,9,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,"Saru, you need to abort! Structural integrity compromised."
4,9,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,"Structural integrity compromised. Owosekun, how much time do they have left?"
4,9,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Owosekun, how much time do they have left? Hull integrity down to ten percent."
4,9,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,Hull integrity down to ten percent. Book?
4,9,BURNHAM,NILSSON,"Book? Captain, there's a massive electromagnetic surge coming from Book's ship."
4,9,NILSSON,BURNHAM,"Captain, there's a massive electromagnetic surge coming from Book's ship. Saru, maximum thrusters, now!"
4,9,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,"Saru, maximum thrusters, now! Hull breach imminent."
4,9,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,Hull breach imminent. Can you get a lock now?
4,9,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Can you get a lock now? I'm working on it, Captain."
4,9,OWOSEKUN,DETMER,"I'm working on it, Captain. The shuttle's breaking apart."
4,9,DETMER,BURNHAM,The shuttle's breaking apart. Owosekun?
4,9,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,Owosekun? Almost got them.
4,9,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,Almost got them. Is everyone all right?
4,9,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Okay, let's get back to stations. Commander Bryce, let me know what you find with Doctor Kovich. Captain, we just lost the tracker signal."
4,9,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Figuring that out is next on my list. Cloaking will be spotty, at best. It's impacting shield stability. Scanning range is limited, as well."
4,9,OWOSEKUN,DETMER,"Cloaking will be spotty, at best. It's impacting shield stability. Scanning range is limited, as well. It's like finding a needle in a haystack, as my grandma used to say."
4,9,DETMER,BURNHAM,"It's like finding a needle in a haystack, as my grandma used to say. Detmer, plot a grid search pattern."
4,9,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Detmer, plot a grid search pattern. Aye, Captain."
4,9,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Aye, Captain. Owosekun, scan for the subspace rift around the DMA controller. Given its size, it should be easier to find than the device itself."
4,9,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Owosekun, scan for the subspace rift around the DMA controller. Given its size, it should be easier to find than the device itself. Aye, Captain."
4,9,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"Aye, Captain. Commander Nilsson, you have the conn."
4,9,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,Let's do it together. The sensors are picking up an energy spike.
4,9,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,The sensors are picking up an energy spike. Is it the controller?
4,9,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,Is it the controller? I... I can't tell.
4,9,OWOSEKUN,DETMER,I... I can't tell. It's an object of some kind. Booker's ship dead ahead!
4,9,DETMER,BURNHAM,It's an object of some kind. Booker's ship dead ahead! Ten degrees hard to port!
4,9,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Ten degrees hard to port! Aye, Captain."
4,9,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Aye, Captain. Or we could burn out Book's scanners, make it impossible for them to find the controller. Rhys, launch a full spread of sensor-blinding bursts at Book's ship as we pass, maximum energy yield."
4,9,BURNHAM,DETMER,"We will avoid the blast if we dive in low, and that'll blind Book long enough for us to get out of here. Detmer, on my mark, full power astern. Adjust course 18 mark four. Aye, Captain."
4,9,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Aye, Captain. Here comes the blast. Now! Take us into that dark matter dust cloud 20 degrees off our starboard beam. Once we're in, resume the grid search."
4,9,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Here comes the blast. Now! Take us into that dark matter dust cloud 20 degrees off our starboard beam. Once we're in, resume the grid search. Aye, Captain."
4,9,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"Captain, I'm getting strong sensor contact. High concentration of galactic barrier particles. It's the subspace rift. Great work, Owosekun. Detmer, set a course. Stamets, where are we with that boronite timetable?"
4,9,BURNHAM,DETMER,"No. That's it, Captain. The DMA controller."
4,9,DETMER,BURNHAM,"That's it, Captain. The DMA controller. Give us a closer look."
4,9,BURNHAM,NILSSON,"Give us a closer look. The Ten-C don't care, do they? Churn space, take boronite. Rinse and repeat."
4,9,NILSSON,BURNHAM,"The Ten-C don't care, do they? Churn space, take boronite. Rinse and repeat. We will stop them, and we'll do it the right way."
4,9,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"Aye, Captain. Stamets, let Zora take over. I need you to jump."
4,9,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,"Stamets, let Zora take over. I need you to jump. Warning. Proximity alert."
4,9,DETMER,OWOSEKUN,"Aye, Captain. Shields down to 50%, Captain."
4,9,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Rhys, return fire. Shields down to 20%."
4,9,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,Shields down to 20%. There is no way Book was responsible for that attack.
4,9,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,"Not in the brig. Just there for safety's sake, and it's just one week. And the Federation uses that time to make first contact and work to convince whoever created this thing to withdraw it. And if that fails, they'll back your plan to destroy the controller. Privacy settings activated."
4,9,COMPUTER,BURNHAM,"Privacy settings activated. Thank you. Discovery, I'm on my way back."
4,9,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Thank you. Discovery, I'm on my way back. Captain, they lowered the disruption field. I'm reading a transporter signature."
4,9,OWOSEKUN,NILSSON,"Captain, they lowered the disruption field. I'm reading a transporter signature. And a massive tachyon surge inside the DMA controller."
4,9,NILSSON,BURNHAM,And a massive tachyon surge inside the DMA controller. Can we do anything? Can we stop it?
4,10,BURNHAM,NDOYE,How would the Ten-C know the difference? We have to find a way to communicate the distinction. Isn't that what all these translators are for?
4,10,NDOYE,T'RINA,"Isn't that what all these translators are for? If I may, the very purpose of this task force is to establish the parameters for successful communications. Are you both now suggesting that may be impossible?"
4,10,T'RINA,BURNHAM,"If I may, the very purpose of this task force is to establish the parameters for successful communications. Are you both now suggesting that may be impossible? We have to start the communication process somewhere. The oversight committee has questions."
4,10,BURNHAM,NDOYE,You're not coming? I cannot fathom anything even remotely as urgent as this.
4,10,NDOYE,BURNHAM,"I cannot fathom anything even remotely as urgent as this. Er, Madam President, Admiral. If you'll come with me."
4,10,BURNHAM,T'RINA,"Yes, sir. Madam President. Of course."
4,10,T'RINA,BURNHAM,"Er, Mister Saru, if you will excuse me. Ensign Tal."
4,10,BURNHAM,NILSSON,"(sotto) I can imagine. Commander Nilsson? The mycelial network thins as it approaches the galactic barrier, so Commander Stamets expects us to arrive about four light-years away. We'll warp from there."
4,10,NILSSON,BURNHAM,"The mycelial network thins as it approaches the galactic barrier, so Commander Stamets expects us to arrive about four light-years away. We'll warp from there. Thank you. Commander Detmer, take us to safe distance."
4,10,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Thank you. Commander Detmer, take us to safe distance. Aye, Captain."
4,10,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Aye, Captain. Lieutenant Christopher, open a shipwide channel."
4,10,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,Not the view I was expecting. Where are we in relation to the galactic barrier? It looks like we're nine light-years away.
4,10,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"It looks like we're nine light-years away. Commander Stamets, you owe me five light-years."
4,10,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Commander Detmer, set a course for the galactic barrier. The DMA will move soon. We don't have much time. Maximum warp. Aye, Captain."
4,10,DETMER,T'RINA,"Aye, Captain. Our delegate did not arrive in time. It was decided that Ni'Var must be represented, even if by its president."
4,10,T'RINA,BURNHAM,"Our delegate did not arrive in time. It was decided that Ni'Var must be represented, even if by its president. Commander Detmer, how soon until we reach the galactic barrier?"
4,10,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Commander Detmer, how soon until we reach the galactic barrier? Coming out of warp now, Captain."
4,10,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Coming out of warp now, Captain. But we have a job to do. Double-check shield systems and run a multiphasic scan on the barrier itself. I want to know what we're heading into and how to get ourselves and everyone out quickly and safely. Let's get to it."
4,10,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Status report? Shields are ready, Captain."
4,10,OWOSEKUN,NILSSON,"Shields are ready, Captain. All other systems are nominal."
4,10,NILSSON,BURNHAM,All other systems are nominal. Mister Saru?
4,10,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Commander Detmer, plot a course. Let's get through the barrier as fast as we can. It'll be bumpy."
4,10,DETMER,BURNHAM,It'll be bumpy. Red alert.
4,10,BURNHAM,DETMER,Red alert. We're inside the barrier.
4,10,DETMER,BURNHAM,We're inside the barrier. No kidding.
4,10,BURNHAM,DETMER,No kidding. Closing in on the spacial cell.
4,10,DETMER,OWOSEKUN,Closing in on the spacial cell. Shields dropping to 85%. 75%.
4,10,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,Shields dropping to 85%. 75%. Mister Saru?
4,10,BURNHAM,DETMER,How much longer? Adjusting course!
4,10,DETMER,OWOSEKUN,Adjusting course! Shields down to 45%. 35.
4,10,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,Shields down to 45%. 35. Take us in.
4,10,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Take us in. Aye, Captain. Holding steady."
4,10,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Aye, Captain. Holding steady. Good work. Maintain position. Let's get shields repaired. Let's keep an eye on cell stability in here."
4,10,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Zora? Can you restore the rest? I'm sorry, Captain, it's damaged beyond repair."
4,10,ZORA,BURNHAM,"I'm sorry, Captain, it's damaged beyond repair. We can't afford to do that. Not now. We have to stay the course. We have to get to the Ten-C. I need to tell my crew."
4,10,BURNHAM,DETMER,Earth is home for so many of my crew. They deserve to know. It's like a traffic jam.
4,10,DETMER,BURNHAM,It's like a traffic jam. What can we do here?
4,10,BURNHAM,DETMER,What can we do here? Not much. I can't control the trajectory of the cell we're in.
4,10,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Not much. I can't control the trajectory of the cell we're in. Commander Stamets, have you found a way to get us moving yet?"
4,10,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Commander Stamets, have you found a way to get us moving yet? Captain, I don't think shields will hold long enough to get there."
4,10,ZORA,BURNHAM,"Captain, I don't think shields will hold long enough to get there. Moving through the unstable cells will expose us to negative energy and a lot of it. How long will our shields hold?"
4,10,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Moving through the unstable cells will expose us to negative energy and a lot of it. How long will our shields hold? Maybe five minutes, at this point."
4,10,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"Maybe five minutes, at this point. We don't have any other options. Engineering, can you do anything to buy us more time?"
4,10,BURNHAM,DETMER,"That'll have to do. Commander Detmer, plot us a course. Aye, Captain. Leaving our spatial cell now."
4,10,DETMER,BURNHAM,We just lost one of our forward emitters. Ensign Tal?
4,10,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Commander Detmer, how much longer until we reach the target cell? It's dead ahead. Few more minutes."
4,10,DETMER,BURNHAM,"It's dead ahead. Few more minutes. Commander Owosekun, how are we doing on shields?"
4,10,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Commander Owosekun, how are we doing on shields? Down to four percent!"
4,10,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,Down to four percent! Engineering?
4,10,BURNHAM,NILSSON,"Engineering? Hey. We've got this. A month from now, you'll be back skiing in Zermatt."
4,10,NILSSON,DETMER,"Astoria, on Earth's Oregon Coast. It's heaven. Hawaii, for me. The beach, a mai tai. Maybe I'll take up snorkeling."
4,10,DETMER,BURNHAM,"I've locked onto the target cell, Captain! Stamets, we'll need those 30 seconds on shields right now!"
4,10,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Always appreciated. Owosekun, track our time. Detmer, on your mark. Aye, Captain. Here we go!"
4,10,DETMER,OWOSEKUN,"Aye, Captain. Here we go! 15 seconds! Fourteen. Thirteen. Twelve. Eleven. Ten. Nine. Eight. Sev... Oh!"
4,10,OWOSEKUN,DETMER,15 seconds! Fourteen. Thirteen. Twelve. Eleven. Ten. Nine. Eight. Sev... Oh! We're in. Six seconds to spare.
4,10,DETMER,BURNHAM,"We're in. Six seconds to spare. Nothing like cutting it close, huh? Great work, Detmer. Great job, everyone. Mister Saru, let's get a team on repairs. You have the conn. Madam President. A word?"
4,10,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Nothing like cutting it close, huh? Great work, Detmer. Great job, everyone. Mister Saru, let's get a team on repairs. You have the conn. Madam President. A word? Well done, Commander."
4,10,ZORA,BURNHAM,"Well done, Commander. With respect, I think something else is going on here, for both of us."
4,10,BURNHAM,DETMER,"But it might help you. We're all we have out here, Madam President. We have to support each other. That's what this crew has done in the darkest of times. But to do that takes honesty with ourselves and with everyone. Let me know where you land. Captain, I couldn't be happier to report that we're officially out of the galactic barrier, out of the Milky Way and into extragalactic space."
4,10,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Captain, I couldn't be happier to report that we're officially out of the galactic barrier, out of the Milky Way and into extragalactic space. Well done, all of you."
4,10,BURNHAM,NILSSON,"Well done, all of you. Not many people have gotten to see this."
4,10,NILSSON,DETMER,"Not many people have gotten to see this. Well, Captain, should I set a course for the Ten-C?"
4,10,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Well, Captain, should I set a course for the Ten-C? Lieutenant Christopher, open a channel."
4,10,BURNHAM,NDOYE,Madam President. Madam President.
4,10,NDOYE,T'RINA,Madam President. Could you sit with me a while? I would appreciate your company. I find you a... comforting presence.
4,10,T'RINA,BURNHAM,Could you sit with me a while? I would appreciate your company. I find you a... comforting presence. As much as our long-range scans can show us.
4,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,You got it. Nilsson has the conn. You are in excellent hands.
4,11,BURNHAM,T'RINA,"Madam President, General, Doctor. I appreciate you seeing us off. Captain, I cannot express a greater need for urgency than you must already feel. Please, all of you, travel safely. May you find answers, in whatever form they take, and quickly."
4,11,T'RINA,NDOYE,"Captain, I cannot express a greater need for urgency than you must already feel. Please, all of you, travel safely. May you find answers, in whatever form they take, and quickly. Captain Burnham, I must voice my dismay at this decision. We left delegates behind because time is of the essence. On behalf of the citizens of United Earth, whose lives are in danger in this very moment, I ask that you reconsider, so that we might better commit the precious time that they have left to actually attempting to communicate with the Ten-C. We have much to convey, and no idea how long it will take to do so."
4,11,NDOYE,BURNHAM,"Captain Burnham, I must voice my dismay at this decision. We left delegates behind because time is of the essence. On behalf of the citizens of United Earth, whose lives are in danger in this very moment, I ask that you reconsider, so that we might better commit the precious time that they have left to actually attempting to communicate with the Ten-C. We have much to convey, and no idea how long it will take to do so. I hear you, General. I do. Both Earth and Ni'Var are home to me. Whatever we might find down on that planet, it could cut our communication time in half."
4,11,BURNHAM,NDOYE,"I hear you, General. I do. Both Earth and Ni'Var are home to me. Whatever we might find down on that planet, it could cut our communication time in half. Might. Could. This is quite the gamble for so much uncertainty."
4,11,NDOYE,BURNHAM,Might. Could. This is quite the gamble for so much uncertainty. I am certain that first contact will not go well if we show up to the Ten-C knowing nothing about them. I will find something down there. I promise. We ready?
4,11,BURNHAM,DETMER,"I am certain that first contact will not go well if we show up to the Ten-C knowing nothing about them. I will find something down there. I promise. We ready? Aye, Captain."
4,11,DETMER,COMPUTER,"Disco Zero Nine to Discovery, we're about to enter the ionosphere. Losing comms from there. Protective shielding deployed."
4,11,COMPUTER,DETMER,Protective shielding deployed. Hang on. Ride'll smooth out in a minute.
4,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,Hang on. Ride'll smooth out in a minute. Take a look at these ruins. The way the buildings have collapsed.
4,11,BURNHAM,DETMER,The Ten-C must've lived in the gas layers. But how? They must be unlike any species we've ever encountered.
4,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,"But how? They must be unlike any species we've ever encountered. Well, there has to be something down there to help us communicate with them."
4,11,BURNHAM,DETMER,One less thing to worry about. So we might not be alone.
4,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,So we might not be alone. Make sure they're set to stun.
4,11,BURNHAM,DETMER,Make sure they're set to stun. Are you sure?
4,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,Are you sure? What is that?
4,11,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Let's stay alert. Doctor Culber, what are your scans telling you? What do you think all the blue dust is?"
4,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,Check this out. A mass grave? Scans date these bones to the same time as the fragment strikes.
4,11,BURNHAM,DETMER,Scans date these bones to the same time as the fragment strikes. Even with all their tech.
4,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Even with all their tech. A full-planet evacuation was impossible. It would be for anyone. We need to get into that building, figure out who they are and how to talk to them. Let's go."
4,11,BURNHAM,NDOYE,"What are you feeling? If I were home, at least I could be helping with evacuations or mounting a defence."
4,11,NDOYE,T'RINA,"If I were home, at least I could be helping with evacuations or mounting a defence. We still have time, General. Captain Burnham's mission..."
4,11,T'RINA,NDOYE,"We still have time, General. Captain Burnham's mission... Is a waste of that time. The DMA could destroy both of our worlds within days. How can you be so calm?"
4,11,NDOYE,T'RINA,Is a waste of that time. The DMA could destroy both of our worlds within days. How can you be so calm? Ni'Var's emergency protocols are well defined. I trust my vice president is doing everything according to our plans.
4,11,T'RINA,NDOYE,Ni'Var's emergency protocols are well defined. I trust my vice president is doing everything according to our plans. The math doesn't lie. There are too many. Most will not be saved.
4,11,NDOYE,T'RINA,The math doesn't lie. There are too many. Most will not be saved. We are here to prevent such catastrophe. This is where we can best serve our people.
4,11,T'RINA,NDOYE,"We are here to prevent such catastrophe. This is where we can best serve our people. If we act. We could be meeting with the Ten-C even now, demanding they turn off their bloody device."
4,11,NDOYE,T'RINA,"If we act. We could be meeting with the Ten-C even now, demanding they turn off their bloody device. We cannot communicate if we know nothing about them."
4,11,T'RINA,NDOYE,We cannot communicate if we know nothing about them. Opportunities multiply as they are seized. We should have gone directly into the hyperfield.
4,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,"What do you think this was? Meeting space? Worship area? Maybe an arena? Community structures are common in a large variety of cultures. Maybe we'll find something that'll tell us. We're looking for technology, artefacts, anything that can provide cultural context."
4,11,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Meeting space? Worship area? Maybe an arena? Community structures are common in a large variety of cultures. Maybe we'll find something that'll tell us. We're looking for technology, artefacts, anything that can provide cultural context. Got it."
4,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,Captain? No. Stand back. Ah! Stay back!
4,11,BURNHAM,DETMER,Screaming. Yet.
4,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,Yet. How is it that we're experiencing the same visions?
4,11,BURNHAM,DETMER,There's no evidence of psionic energy or infrasound. Our suits filter out environmental factors. So whatever's doing this is doing it some other way.
4,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,"So whatever's doing this is doing it some other way. Five minutes. We will retrace our steps and figure out what's going on. Detmer, you stay back and keep safe, okay? This mission comes first. If we're not able to fix this, we're gonna need you to go back to the shuttle and contact Discovery. Alone."
4,11,BURNHAM,RENO,"Five minutes. We will retrace our steps and figure out what's going on. Detmer, you stay back and keep safe, okay? This mission comes first. If we're not able to fix this, we're gonna need you to go back to the shuttle and contact Discovery. Alone. Triple-brewed raktajino. Hot as hell, hold the nutmeg. You want one?"
4,11,RENO,BURNHAM,"Pro tip. Don't start with, I want to be you. It's kind of creepy. You'll figure it out. Detmer, are your settings any different than ours?"
4,11,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Detmer, are your settings any different than ours? No. They're all the same. There's no reason I should be fine."
4,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,No. They're all the same. There's no reason I should be fine. Is there any chance... it could be the dust?
4,11,BURNHAM,DETMER,And I touched it when I was examining the trichome. And I haven't come into direct contact with it.
4,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,"And I haven't come into direct contact with it. Okay. The hydrocarbons that you analysed earlier... they weren't found in any of the Federation databases, so maybe our suits wouldn't know how to block them."
4,11,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Okay. The hydrocarbons that you analysed earlier... they weren't found in any of the Federation databases, so maybe our suits wouldn't know how to block them. An unknown substance could get through if its structure was unusual enough. Here, let me recalibrate the programmable-matter filtering system. There."
4,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,"An unknown substance could get through if its structure was unusual enough. Here, let me recalibrate the programmable-matter filtering system. There. So glad you were paying attention in those EV trainings."
4,11,BURNHAM,DETMER,"So glad you were paying attention in those EV trainings. PTSD therapy came in handy, plus the way I grew up. I'm sort of the queen of putting things in boxes."
4,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,"PTSD therapy came in handy, plus the way I grew up. I'm sort of the queen of putting things in boxes. Take a look at this. Think I got something. Through the archway. Look at that."
4,11,BURNHAM,RENO,"Let's go find out what. Shield upgrade means increasing nominal system output. You get that, right?"
4,11,RENO,NDOYE,"Okay, every word of that is bad news. Get moving. If we lose replicators out here, we starve to death. No pressure. President T'Rina? You wished to speak further. Hello? President T'Rina?"
4,11,NDOYE,DETMER,"What you're asking already involves significant risk, so I must insist that it be a backup plan only. You need to give diplomacy time to work. If the Ten-C capitulate before United Earth is in the red zone, you and Mister Tarka must stand down. It can't be coincidence that you all had the same hallucinations."
4,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,"It can't be coincidence that you all had the same hallucinations. It's not. Somehow the hydrocarbons let us see and hear what they did, what it was like when their planet was destroyed."
4,11,BURNHAM,DETMER,This must be a cocoon of some kind. This room was a nursery. That must be why the structure was reinforced - to protect their young.
4,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,That must be why the structure was reinforced - to protect their young. I wonder. Monitor my biosigns.
4,11,BURNHAM,DETMER,"We're feeling love and safety here in the nursery, but outside, where so many of them died, we experienced panic and fear, like they must have. I mean, Kelpien and human biology are significantly different, but these hydrocarbons are affecting us almost identically. Maybe some emotions are universal."
4,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Maybe some emotions are universal. Neither do I, but there is something here. Let's reset our EV suit filters, finish scans and get some samples. We can talk while we work. We've got to get back to Discovery."
4,11,BURNHAM,RENO,"Neither do I, but there is something here. Let's reset our EV suit filters, finish scans and get some samples. We can talk while we work. We've got to get back to Discovery. It almost feels deliberate. What kind of idiot would pull a practical joke in the middle of an existential threat?"
4,11,RENO,BURNHAM,"Who's here? If someone's screwing around, today is not the day. (to Tarka) Please tell me I just spoiled a surprise party. Okay, we know the hydrocarbons convey different emotions. But how? And why?"
4,11,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Their emotions tell a story, give us context. Well, we need more pieces to the puzzle, but yeah, I think that's exactly what they can do. Nice work, all of you. This is what we came for. Let's get this back to the team. Disco Zero Nine to Discovery, we're back in comms range and on our way home."
4,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Disco Zero Nine to Discovery, we're back in comms range and on our way home. If you finish that sentence, I will demote you to ensign. It's okay to not be in control for five minutes."
4,11,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Maybe that's why the Ten-C created the hyperfield. To protect themselves, so they would never again have to experience that kind of fear and pain. The thing I can't reconcile is, they understand what it's like to have their home destroyed, and now they're doing the same to us."
4,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,"The thing I can't reconcile is, they understand what it's like to have their home destroyed, and now they're doing the same to us. I'll have my crew set course for the hyperfield immediately."
4,11,BURNHAM,T'RINA,"I'll have my crew set course for the hyperfield immediately. Mister Saru, if you could use a moment of respite after the challenges of the day, you are welcome to join me for a stroll on the holodeck."
4,11,T'RINA,BURNHAM,"Mister Saru, if you could use a moment of respite after the challenges of the day, you are welcome to join me for a stroll on the holodeck. DMA hits in 25 hours. Take whoever you need to assist with testing the chemicals."
4,11,BURNHAM,DETMER,"It was all of us. And it will continue to be, moving forward. So, thank you. Yeah, I'm glad."
4,11,DETMER,BURNHAM,Or we could mention it every day for the rest of your life. Please sit.
4,11,BURNHAM,RENO,We'll find a way. Ahem.
4,12,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Commander Detmer, how close are we? We're 250,000 kilometres out."
4,12,DETMER,BURNHAM,"We're 250,000 kilometres out. Hold position at 200."
4,12,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Hold position at 200. Aye, Captain."
4,12,DETMER,OWOSEKUN,"Aye, Captain. Yes, ma'am. It has a radius of 1.58 AUs. Gravitational presence is approximately 1.3 solar units."
4,12,OWOSEKUN,NILSSON,"Yes, ma'am. It has a radius of 1.58 AUs. Gravitational presence is approximately 1.3 solar units. To build anything that big..."
4,12,NILSSON,BURNHAM,"To build anything that big... Lieutenant Christopher, have they responded to our message?"
4,12,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"No. We don't want to signal threat or aggression. Owosekun, do scans show any sign of weapons? Negative, Captain. There's no sign of anything. No change of any kind in the hyperfield. It's like they don't even know we're here."
4,12,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"Negative, Captain. There's no sign of anything. No change of any kind in the hyperfield. It's like they don't even know we're here. Madam President, I think it's time we let our first contact team implement the contingency plan."
4,12,BURNHAM,NDOYE,"Logically speaking, if Species Ten-C wanted to respond, they would have done so already. We've got 15 hours before United Earth and Ni'Var start to feel the effects of the DMA. We need to try something new. Won't we need to move closer to the hyperfield in order to deploy them?"
4,12,NDOYE,ZORA,"Is taking on this level of risk really prudent? Commander, do you have a moment?"
4,12,ZORA,RENO,I appreciate the support. Thank you. I never knew being kidnapped could be so boring.
4,12,RENO,DETMER,"Much obliged. We've reached 1,000 metres from the hyperfield."
4,12,DETMER,NILSSON,"We've reached 1,000 metres from the hyperfield. Hydrocarbon compounds are loaded and the DOTs are ready, Captain."
4,12,NILSSON,BURNHAM,"Hydrocarbon compounds are loaded and the DOTs are ready, Captain. Okay, then... let 'em rip."
4,12,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Any changes? A response of any kind? No, Captain."
4,12,OWOSEKUN,NILSSON,"No, Captain. Captain, the DOTs are registering something."
4,12,NILSSON,BURNHAM,"Captain, the DOTs are registering something. What's happening? Owosekun?"
4,12,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,What's happening? Owosekun? I'm getting significant energy spikes on this hyperfield surface.
4,12,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"I'm getting significant energy spikes on this hyperfield surface. Commander Nilsson, pull them back."
4,12,BURNHAM,NILSSON,"Commander Nilsson, pull them back. I'm trying, Captain. Whatever that is, it's too fast."
4,12,NILSSON,BURNHAM,They're gone. Shields up. Red alert.
4,12,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Shields up. Red alert. Another spike, and this one's massive."
4,12,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"Another spike, and this one's massive. Commander Detmer, get us out of here now. Maximum warp."
4,12,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Commander Detmer, get us out of here now. Maximum warp. Aye, Captain."
4,12,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Aye, Captain. What's happening?"
4,12,BURNHAM,DETMER,What's happening? I'm losing engines.
4,12,DETMER,NILSSON,I'm losing engines. Shields are failing.
4,12,NILSSON,BURNHAM,Shields are failing. Commander Detmer?
4,12,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Commander Detmer? I can't get us out, Captain."
4,12,DETMER,BURNHAM,"I can't get us out, Captain. Status report."
4,12,BURNHAM,DETMER,They've enacted a selective shutdown of some kind. We need to get those systems back up and running. Working on it.
4,12,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Working on it. Owosekun, what else are scans telling us?"
4,12,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Owosekun, what else are scans telling us? Well, it looks like we're now inside the hyperfield. No sign of the DOTs. There's a solar system in here, three gas giant planets. Mass and chemical composition are all identical."
4,12,OWOSEKUN,DETMER,"Well, it looks like we're now inside the hyperfield. No sign of the DOTs. There's a solar system in here, three gas giant planets. Mass and chemical composition are all identical. The orb is taking us to one of the planets."
4,12,DETMER,NILSSON,The orb is taking us to one of the planets. We're like a bug in a jar.
4,12,NILSSON,BURNHAM,"We're like a bug in a jar. Lieutenant Christopher, tell Stamets to assemble a team and figure out a way to get us out of this thing."
4,12,BURNHAM,NDOYE,"Lieutenant Christopher, tell Stamets to assemble a team and figure out a way to get us out of this thing. I'm alone now. We can speak."
4,12,NDOYE,RENO,"Scared, same as the rest of us. She just hides it better. Come on. Come on. Shit."
4,12,RENO,DETMER,"Come on. Come on. Shit. Captain, the orb we're in has stopped moving. Looks like we're in the upper layers of the planet's atmosphere."
4,12,DETMER,OWOSEKUN,"Captain, the orb we're in has stopped moving. Looks like we're in the upper layers of the planet's atmosphere. Sensors show life signs all around us. Hundreds of them."
4,12,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,Sensors show life signs all around us. Hundreds of them. Any progress restoring systems?
4,12,BURNHAM,NILSSON,Any progress restoring systems? Engineering says that the orb is somehow keeping them powered down. Nothing they've tried has worked.
4,12,NILSSON,BURNHAM,Engineering says that the orb is somehow keeping them powered down. Nothing they've tried has worked. Have them try something else.
4,12,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Commander Rhys, you have the conn. Let me know if anything changes. I appreciate that. Thank you."
4,12,ZORA,T'RINA,I'll set it up for us. Speculation is of little use in this moment. We require answers.
4,12,T'RINA,BURNHAM,Speculation is of little use in this moment. We require answers. Could it be that they're using a communication frequency we're unaware of?
4,12,BURNHAM,NDOYE,Could it be that they're using a communication frequency we're unaware of? We cannot hope to conduct effective diplomacy as prisoners.
4,12,NDOYE,BURNHAM,"We don't even know how to get them to speak to us. I have an idea. For centuries, it's been Federation tradition to present a gift during first contact as a way of building trust. Stamets collected a few samples of boronite from the site of the DMA implosion."
4,12,BURNHAM,T'RINA,It's the only thing we know for sure they want. I'm not sure what other choice we have. How could we possibly deliver it?
4,12,T'RINA,BURNHAM,How could we possibly deliver it? We could beam the particles directly onto the orb membrane. It sized itself to fit our ship. It has to have sensor capabilities.
4,12,RENO,NDOYE,"Doesn't mean I'm wrong. You're feeling it out as you go, adapting, making choices. I respect that. But a soldier has to accept when they've hit a wall. That's when the truly hard choices need to be made."
4,12,NDOYE,BURNHAM,"You're feeling it out as you go, adapting, making choices. I respect that. But a soldier has to accept when they've hit a wall. That's when the truly hard choices need to be made. I used to think there was no wall. As captain, my experience has taught me otherwise. General, we haven't hit it yet."
4,12,BURNHAM,ZORA,"I used to think there was no wall. As captain, my experience has taught me otherwise. General, we haven't hit it yet. Captain, scans show changes to the orb membrane near the shuttle bay."
4,12,ZORA,BURNHAM,"Captain, scans show changes to the orb membrane near the shuttle bay. Here we go."
4,12,BURNHAM,ZORA,"So we'll have to learn another way to talk to each other. Captain, the being is excreting a mist of large organic molecule clusters."
4,12,ZORA,BURNHAM,"Captain, the being is excreting a mist of large organic molecule clusters. Can you analyse them, Zora?"
4,12,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Can you analyse them, Zora? Of course. All of the supramolecules are identical. Each is comprised of dozens of the same hydrocarbons you found on their home planet."
4,12,ZORA,BURNHAM,"Each molecule is 25% joy, 22% sadness, 17% peacefulness, 14% irritation, 12% surprise and ten percent fear. That's six of the emotions we know they can feel."
4,12,BURNHAM,NDOYE,That's six of the emotions we know they can feel. It's nonsensical.
4,12,NDOYE,T'RINA,It's nonsensical. Perhaps it is attempting to convey all six emotions simultaneously?
4,12,T'RINA,BURNHAM,Perhaps it is attempting to convey all six emotions simultaneously? Incredible.
4,12,BURNHAM,ZORA,"That complex of a pattern has to be for communication, somehow. You may be right, Captain. The light pattern was identical both times."
4,12,ZORA,NDOYE,"You may be right, Captain. The light pattern was identical both times. Sounds like the start of a frighteningly long process."
4,12,NDOYE,BURNHAM,"Hmm. Zora, can you project the light pattern back to the Ten-C?"
4,12,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Zora, can you project the light pattern back to the Ten-C? Yes, Captain. I just need a moment."
4,12,ZORA,NDOYE,"Yes, Captain. I just need a moment. Fine, except that the universal translators won't work. Communication needs to start from scratch, and we have only 12 hours before the DMA reaches Earth."
4,12,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Once Zora projects the pattern back to them, hopefully the Ten-C respond with a new message. Mister Saru, stand by for analysis. Ready, Zora? I am. Sending the message now."
4,12,ZORA,T'RINA,I am. Sending the message now. What happened? Why is it leaving?
4,12,T'RINA,BURNHAM,"What happened? Why is it leaving? Maybe they want us to answer back, not just mimic."
4,12,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Zora, compare the pattern to both Federation and non-Federation linguistic databases. Great minds think alike, Captain. I was just doing so. Unfortunately, there's no known comparison."
4,12,ZORA,T'RINA,"Great minds think alike, Captain. I was just doing so. Unfortunately, there's no known comparison. You're saying it's not a language?"
4,12,T'RINA,BURNHAM,"You're saying it's not a language? Well, there is a pattern here. We just have to find it."
4,12,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Detmer, Nilsson, Christopher. Please report to shuttle bay, now. The game's helping. I still can't identify the exact moment I started feeling so distracted, but I found an anomalous eventthat occurred around the same time. A replicator-system malfunction. Commander Reno fixed it."
4,12,ZORA,T'RINA,My sensors show her in Engineering. How could the hydrocarbons contain emotional and semantic content?
4,12,T'RINA,NILSSON,"How could the hydrocarbons contain emotional and semantic content? Maybe it's like music. A piano piece evokes emotion but also has a structure of pitches, note lengths, tempo."
4,12,NILSSON,BURNHAM,"Maybe it's like music. A piano piece evokes emotion but also has a structure of pitches, note lengths, tempo. Yes, what if the hydrocarbons are the structure? If each is a symbol, or a word, then the molecules themselves are the message."
4,12,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Okay. If we're meant to read this, how do we do it? Where do we start? Which direction do we go? Maybe the lights are a key. A star map is a 2D rendering to help us navigate 3D space. Maybe the Ten-C's light pattern is a map to help us read the hydrocarbons in a specific order?"
4,12,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Maybe the lights are a key. A star map is a 2D rendering to help us navigate 3D space. Maybe the Ten-C's light pattern is a map to help us read the hydrocarbons in a specific order? Zora, show us the light pattern. Can you turn this into a 3D model using maximum brightness levels as the Z-axis variable?"
4,12,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Zora, show us the light pattern. Can you turn this into a 3D model using maximum brightness levels as the Z-axis variable? Of course, Captain."
4,12,ZORA,BURNHAM,"Of course, Captain. If I move the light map over the molecule... Oh."
4,12,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Zora, start analysing. Yes, Captain."
4,12,ZORA,BURNHAM,"Yes, Captain. Thank you. I'll see you all on the bridge."
4,12,BURNHAM,RENO,"Thank you. I'll see you all on the bridge. Hey, Book the Fifth, you've been replicating my licorice refill since the dawn of time."
4,12,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Er, how are we doing, Zora? Were you able to decode the molecule? I believe so. I assigned a letter to each of the individual hydrocarbons, and then placed them in the order designated by the lights. The resulting pattern seems to represent a series of mathematical equations."
4,12,ZORA,NDOYE,"I believe so. I assigned a letter to each of the individual hydrocarbons, and then placed them in the order designated by the lights. The resulting pattern seems to represent a series of mathematical equations. You say that like it's obvious."
4,12,NDOYE,T'RINA,You say that like it's obvious. Mister Saru?
4,12,T'RINA,BURNHAM,"Lincos? A language based on math. The 21st-century Earth organisation METI predicted that it would be helpful in extraplanetary communication. The Ten-C must think that their language is too complicated for us to understand, so they're using this simpler one. They're reaching back."
4,12,BURNHAM,ZORA,"A language based on math. The 21st-century Earth organisation METI predicted that it would be helpful in extraplanetary communication. The Ten-C must think that their language is too complicated for us to understand, so they're using this simpler one. They're reaching back. I'd be happy to assist, Doctor."
4,12,ZORA,BURNHAM,"I'd be happy to assist, Doctor. Great. Get to work, both of you."
4,12,BURNHAM,NDOYE,"Great. Get to work, both of you. President T'Rina, may I have a word? Shouldn't we be using this time to try and get out of the orb?"
4,12,NDOYE,BURNHAM,"President T'Rina, may I have a word? Shouldn't we be using this time to try and get out of the orb? Everything all right?"
4,12,BURNHAM,NDOYE,Everything all right? It makes no sense to sit here as prisoners.
4,12,NDOYE,BURNHAM,"It makes no sense to sit here as prisoners. It's not surprising. Logic above all. Vulcans often overcompensate in public to prove a point, especially when close relationships are involved. Sarek used to do it all the time. It drove me crazy."
4,12,BURNHAM,COMPUTER,I love math. Let's just hope it's enough to bring them back. Warning.
4,12,COMPUTER,T'RINA,Warning. It seems the message was a success.
4,12,T'RINA,ZORA,"It seems the message was a success. We're receiving new molecules. Sending the hydrocarbon analysis to your holoPADD, Doctor Hirai."
4,12,ZORA,BURNHAM,"We're receiving new molecules. Sending the hydrocarbon analysis to your holoPADD, Doctor Hirai. We have started to communicate."
4,12,BURNHAM,ZORA,"We have started to communicate. Captain, an object is approaching."
4,12,ZORA,BURNHAM,"Captain, an object is approaching. Mister Saru?"
4,12,BURNHAM,RENO,That's how they want to keep talking. They want us to go inside. You have a funny way of showing it. What you're doing is wrong.
4,12,RENO,NDOYE,You have a funny way of showing it. What you're doing is wrong. We can't be sure it's even safe to go inside.
4,12,NDOYE,BURNHAM,"We can't be sure it's even safe to go inside. If they wanted to hurt us, they could've done it already."
4,12,BURNHAM,T'RINA,"If they wanted to hurt us, they could've done it already. I will advocate for my planet, whatever is required."
4,12,T'RINA,NDOYE,"I will advocate for my planet, whatever is required. I have faith you'll convey the necessary message. I'm of greater use here on the outside."
4,12,NDOYE,BURNHAM,"I have faith you'll convey the necessary message. I'm of greater use here on the outside. Zora shouldn't come, given all the unknowns."
4,12,BURNHAM,ZORA,There is no one I would rather go into this with. My sensors say she's present.
4,12,ZORA,T'RINA,"Commander Jett Reno, please report to Engineering. Commander Reno. I wish I could say the same. I must admit, I am not certain how to step into danger with one for whom I have such personal fondness. Perhaps this is one of the reasons I avoid closeness with others."
4,12,T'RINA,BURNHAM,"I wish I could say the same. I must admit, I am not certain how to step into danger with one for whom I have such personal fondness. Perhaps this is one of the reasons I avoid closeness with others. All right. Let's go."
4,12,BURNHAM,T'RINA,All right. Let's go. Were we beamed onto the bridge? Where is everyone?
4,12,T'RINA,BURNHAM,Were we beamed onto the bridge? Where is everyone? The Ten-C created an environment where they thought we'd be comfortable.
4,12,BURNHAM,T'RINA,It's not armed. They must've built it from data they collected on the one Tarka detonated in the DMA. Is it intended as a threat?
4,12,T'RINA,BURNHAM,Is it intended as a threat? And there are the lights.
4,12,BURNHAM,T'RINA,178 is the atomic number for isolynium. The DMA.
4,12,T'RINA,BURNHAM,The DMA. Isolytic weapon plus DMA equals curiosity. It's a question. They put the weapon here to help us understand. They want to know why the weapon was put in the DMA.
4,12,BURNHAM,NDOYE,"Okay. Let's figure out how to say that with math. Booker, it's Ndoye. Your captain and a team went to talk with the Ten-C and now they're gone. Scans can't find the orb they entered into. Can you see it at all?"
4,12,NDOYE,BURNHAM,"It's done. Just make sure you stop the damn thing in time. So, we agree on our response. DMA plus us equals the terror hydrocarbon."
4,12,BURNHAM,T'RINA,"So, we agree on our response. DMA plus us equals the terror hydrocarbon. Or six, the atomic number of carbon. We are carbon-based."
4,12,T'RINA,BURNHAM,"Or six, the atomic number of carbon. We are carbon-based. But what President T'Rina said, using our own biology... The air. The air. They've created an artificial atmosphere based on the exact ratio of gases we need to breathe. 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.93% argon and 0.04% carbon dioxide. They will recognise that as us."
4,12,BURNHAM,T'RINA,"But what President T'Rina said, using our own biology... The air. The air. They've created an artificial atmosphere based on the exact ratio of gases we need to breathe. 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.93% argon and 0.04% carbon dioxide. They will recognise that as us. Great sadness."
4,12,T'RINA,BURNHAM,"Great sadness. Ah. That means they understand, and it means they have empathy."
4,12,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Now we just need to figure out how to ask them to turn off the DMA. I think I found something. I've been analysing every discrete event in this sector of the ship during the time range in question. Access Panel 4351 was opened briefly at one point, but the maintenance check isn't scheduled until tomorrow."
4,12,ZORA,OWOSEKUN,Plasma's venting from one of the nacelles. It's burning a hole in the orb.
4,12,OWOSEKUN,NILSSON,It's burning a hole in the orb. Someone entered override codes.
4,12,NILSSON,DETMER,Someone entered override codes. Nothing. They're gone.
4,12,DETMER,T'RINA,Nothing. They're gone. They sent us back. Why?
4,12,T'RINA,BURNHAM,They sent us back. Why? What? They're here?
4,12,RENO,BURNHAM,I'll talk fast. Can we get out the same way they did?
4,13,TILLY,BURNHAM,"Please hurry, Michael. Where is Stamets on getting us out of this orb?"
4,13,BURNHAM,RENO,"I'm going to confine them all to quarters. I think you should be there when I tell them. If I had some hot and sour soup. Wouldn't help us, I'm just hungry. The upside is, when we hit the hyperfield, we'll be vaporised immediately."
4,13,RENO,BURNHAM,"We'll die fast. I hate pain. I'm sorry, Madam President, but plasma doesn't vent itself. This entire mission is compromised."
4,13,BURNHAM,NDOYE,"I'll fill you in once everyone is here, but I'm gonna need to lock you all down. That won't be necessary. I'm the one who aided their escape."
4,13,NDOYE,BURNHAM,"United Earth is running out of time, and you were all gone. We had no idea where the orb went, when you'd be back, or if you were even still alive. They can stop the DMA right now. No, no. Billions of people might still die."
4,13,BURNHAM,NDOYE,"No, no. Billions of people might still die. No. Mister Booker assured me that..."
4,13,BURNHAM,NDOYE,Officer Zena. Please confine General Ndoye to her quarters. Captain. Madam President. I remain ready and willing to serve.
4,13,NDOYE,BURNHAM,Captain. Madam President. I remain ready and willing to serve. What did they say?
4,13,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Are we sure the message was clear, Zora? For that particular exchange, I estimate our accuracy to be in the 96th percentile."
4,13,ZORA,T'RINA,"The nuances of that could take quite a long time. If... I can connect with them telepathically, I may be able to convey our desire to protect them."
4,13,T'RINA,BURNHAM,I have made contact. Break the link.
4,13,BURNHAM,T'RINA,"Break the link. We have to break it. Break the link. Madam President? Madam President! Are you okay? What happened? They... they are confused, terrified. They cannot stop Booker's ship, and they no longer trust us. We... we must find another way to reach them, or I fear that our worlds are already doomed."
4,13,T'RINA,POLLARD,"They... they are confused, terrified. They cannot stop Booker's ship, and they no longer trust us. We... we must find another way to reach them, or I fear that our worlds are already doomed. Heart rate and blood pressure are still elevated, but her neural activity's returning to normal."
4,13,POLLARD,BURNHAM,"Heart rate and blood pressure are still elevated, but her neural activity's returning to normal. Madam President, is there anything else you can tell us about them?"
4,13,BURNHAM,T'RINA,"Madam President, is there anything else you can tell us about them? The experience was... unusual. Our connection, I... I was not feeling one of the Ten-C but all of them."
4,13,T'RINA,BURNHAM,"No. No, quite different. There was a sense of harmony with one another. It's difficult to describe, but I believe they may not have any awareness of individual existence as we know it. We're on our way. Keep us posted."
4,13,BURNHAM,RENO,We're on our way. Keep us posted. Unless another orb chases us into the hyperfield and we all die.
4,13,BURNHAM,RENO,Do it. Are you gonna tell me what the hell that is?
4,13,RENO,BURNHAM,"Is this where I get to say I was born ready? A cat door. Commander Stamets, are you set?"
4,13,BURNHAM,DETMER,Do not stop it. This is our only shot. We're out of the orb. Impulse engines are back up and running. Warp drive is gonna take a while.
4,13,DETMER,NILSSON,"We're out of the orb. Impulse engines are back up and running. Warp drive is gonna take a while. Spore drive's down, as expected."
4,13,NILSSON,BURNHAM,"Spore drive's down, as expected. Any other orbs on the way?"
4,13,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,Any other orbs on the way? None. Seems they're letting us go.
4,13,OWOSEKUN,DETMER,"None. Seems they're letting us go. Exiting the gas giant now, Captain."
4,13,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Exiting the gas giant now, Captain. Get us back to Book's ship as fast as you can. The Ten-C won't talk to us until we stop Tarka."
4,13,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Get us back to Book's ship as fast as you can. The Ten-C won't talk to us until we stop Tarka. Aye, Captain."
4,13,DETMER,RENO,"Aye, Captain. Here's to holo disruptors. Think I might actually start to like that cat of yours. I can't get into the system. It's on autopilot. Ten minutes until I get to the power source and the hyperfield goes boom."
4,13,RENO,DETMER,"So much for calling in the cavalry. Book's ship back in range, Captain."
4,13,DETMER,BURNHAM,"Book's ship back in range, Captain. Can you get us any closer?"
4,13,BURNHAM,DETMER,Can you get us any closer? Not with those plasma bursts.
4,13,DETMER,OWOSEKUN,"Not with those plasma bursts. Captain, someone's beaming aboard. I've got a lock. It's Commander Reno."
4,13,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"Captain, someone's beaming aboard. I've got a lock. It's Commander Reno. Bring her to the bridge. Commander, are you okay?"
4,13,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,Okay. We need options. Booker's ship is protected by a pattern interrupter. I can't get a lock unless they choose to leave.
4,13,OWOSEKUN,NILSSON,"Booker's ship is protected by a pattern interrupter. I can't get a lock unless they choose to leave. Only if they stop their gravimetric beam first. Otherwise, we could destroy the hyperfield ourselves."
4,13,NILSSON,TILLY,"Only if they stop their gravimetric beam first. Otherwise, we could destroy the hyperfield ourselves. We have incoming. Near-Earth debris pushed by gravitational waves at 2,100 kilometres per second. That's the DMA."
4,13,TILLY,NDOYE,"No, sir. She's helping with the evacuation. She said she won't leave until the last possible moment. I presume you've considered the obvious. Tractor beam and the like."
4,13,NDOYE,BURNHAM,I presume you've considered the obvious. Tractor beam and the like. We have.
4,13,BURNHAM,NDOYE,We have. What about a targeted hit? We could send a shuttle on autopilot.
4,13,NDOYE,NILSSON,What about a targeted hit? We could send a shuttle on autopilot. Gravimetric flux will disrupt navigation. Somebody would have to be on the controls to stay on target.
4,13,NILSSON,OWOSEKUN,Gravimetric flux will disrupt navigation. Somebody would have to be on the controls to stay on target. I don't think I could beam them out in time.
4,13,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"I don't think I could beam them out in time. If we don't stop Tarka, the Ten-C will never stop the DMA. Earth and Ni'Var may already be getting hit. We'll need a great pilot."
4,13,BURNHAM,DETMER,"If we don't stop Tarka, the Ten-C will never stop the DMA. Earth and Ni'Var may already be getting hit. We'll need a great pilot. I'm ready, Captain."
4,13,DETMER,NDOYE,"I'm ready, Captain. Let me do it."
4,13,NDOYE,BURNHAM,Let me do it. General?
4,13,BURNHAM,NDOYE,"General? I have years of experience as a combat pilot. United Earth is my home. Its citizens are my family. I've spent the last 20 years fighting to protect both. That is where my decision to help Booker and Tarka came from. Whether or not you would have made the same choice, you must understand it."
4,13,NDOYE,BURNHAM,"I have years of experience as a combat pilot. United Earth is my home. Its citizens are my family. I've spent the last 20 years fighting to protect both. That is where my decision to help Booker and Tarka came from. Whether or not you would have made the same choice, you must understand it. Owosekun, prepare to beam the general to shuttle bay."
4,13,BURNHAM,NDOYE,"Owosekun, prepare to beam the general to shuttle bay. (removes comm-badge) If I don't make it back, please tell the president I gave my all for Earth."
4,13,NDOYE,BURNHAM,"(removes comm-badge) If I don't make it back, please tell the president I gave my all for Earth. I will."
4,13,BURNHAM,TILLY,"I will. Bridge propulsion systems just went down, Admiral. We're stuck."
4,13,TILLY,COMPUTER,"I know, sir. Four minutes to casement breach."
4,13,COMPUTER,NDOYE,"Warning. Proximity alert. I'll get there in time, Captain."
4,13,NDOYE,BURNHAM,"I'll get there in time, Captain. Get ready, Owosekun."
4,13,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Get ready, Owosekun. Aye, Captain."
4,13,OWOSEKUN,DETMER,"Aye, Captain. She did it, Captain. The hyperfield is safe."
4,13,DETMER,OWOSEKUN,"She did it, Captain. The hyperfield is safe. And I've got General Ndoye."
4,13,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,And I've got General Ndoye. Good. Beam her straight to sickbay. Are there any life signs on Book's ship?
4,13,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,Good. Beam her straight to sickbay. Are there any life signs on Book's ship? Two. They both made it.
4,13,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,Two. They both made it. See if you can beam them on board as well. The hit may have taken out their pattern interrupter.
4,13,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,See if you can beam them on board as well. The hit may have taken out their pattern interrupter. I'm trying. I can't get a lock.
4,13,OWOSEKUN,COMPUTER,I'm trying. I can't get a lock. 90 seconds to impact.
4,13,COMPUTER,OWOSEKUN,30 seconds to impact. I have a new transport signature. Book. It's faint.
4,13,BURNHAM,TILLY,Let's go finish this. Prepare to reenter the orb. Oh.
4,13,TILLY,BURNHAM,"My mom and I didn't have an easy relationship at all, but I always knew she loved me. That's the most important thing. That's what I remember. Commander Detmer, where are we?"
4,13,BURNHAM,DETMER,"Commander Detmer, where are we? Still descending, heading deeper into the gas giant."
4,13,DETMER,OWOSEKUN,"Still descending, heading deeper into the gas giant. Scans show we're approaching a structure of massive proportions."
4,13,OWOSEKUN,DETMER,Scans show we're approaching a structure of massive proportions. Like on their homeworld?
4,13,DETMER,BURNHAM,Like on their homeworld? Maybe.
4,13,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Maybe. Wherever they're taking us, there are thousands of life signs."
4,13,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,"Wherever they're taking us, there are thousands of life signs. Mister Saru, Doctor Harai, meet us in shuttle bay. Zora, join us there as well. And all of you, we don't have much time left. We should all be there for this."
4,13,BURNHAM,ZORA,"Ah, Commander Stamets, are we ready? I'm joining you now, Captain."
4,13,ZORA,BURNHAM,"I'm joining you now, Captain. Thank you. All of you."
4,13,BURNHAM,TILLY,"We experienced your fear and your pain, when you had to leave your former home. When so many of your loved ones were left behind. And that is what we are feeling right now. You have to stop your device. Otherwise it will destroy our planets as well, and billions will die. Do not let history repeat. Did the DMA just... stop?"
4,13,BURNHAM,TILLY,Saru will translate. They did it.
4,13,TILLY,BURNHAM,"They did it. Commander Rhys, cancel red alert."
4,13,BURNHAM,OWOSEKUN,"Commander Rhys, cancel red alert. Scans show a wormhole forming. It's approaching at a rate of 15 kilometres a second."
4,13,OWOSEKUN,BURNHAM,Scans show a wormhole forming. It's approaching at a rate of 15 kilometres a second. We're going home.
4,13,BURNHAM,TILLY,Indeed we have. Oh. What? Tilly! I love you. I missed you.
4,13,TILLY,T'RINA,"Okay, but you're doing great. And then, you know, the times that it's hard, that's what family's for. Not at all. I was just thinking about Ni'Var."
4,13,T'RINA,BURNHAM,Please. You must call me T'Rina. Come.
4,13,BURNHAM,DETMER,Hmm. How's it going?
4,13,BURNHAM,NDOYE,"We were lucky to have each other, ma'am. We couldn't have succeeded otherwise. Yes. I haven't had that close a call in quite a while."
4,13,NDOYE,BURNHAM,"I'm ever at your service, Madam President. Of course."
